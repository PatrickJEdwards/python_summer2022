"August 04, 2022","Remarks During a Virtual Roundtable Discussion With Business and Labor Leaders on Legislation To Combat Inflation, Promote Clean Energy Production, and Reduce Prescription Drug Costs ","The President. Good afternoon, folks. I'm here with leaders from some of the—America's largest companies and labor organizations: Kaiser Permanente, General Motors, Cummins, Carrier, Ameren, you know, we—the United Auto Workers, the AFL-CIO.
They're all here because they believe that the Inflation Reduction Act meets the needs of working families now and what our economy needs now for stronger, sustained economic growth in the years ahead.
Let me tell you a few things about what this bill does. First, it will lower health care costs for millions of Americans who buy coverage from the Affordable Care Act, locking in the health care premiums that save 13 million people an average of $800 a year.
This comes on top the news that we have the lowest percentage of Americans who are uninsured than ever before in our history, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, as well as the American Rescue Plan that I signed into law last year that saved families an average of $240—$2,400 in premiums—$2,400 in premiums.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also going to deliver on a promise Washington has made for years: give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices. This bill will save the American people and Medicare hundreds of billions of dollars. It's going to cap the amount of money seniors pay for prescription drugs at $2,000 a year—period—whether it's for cancer or for other diseases and the treatments they need. Maximum $2,000 a year. That's a Godsend for so many families.
Second, we're going to invest $369 billion to address the climate crisis and bring down family energy bills by an average of $500 a year. We're going to do this providing—by providing working families rebates to buy new and efficient appliances, weatherize their homes, and tax credits for everything from heat pumps to rooftop solar to wind energy.
It also provides tax credits to spur the construction of energy projects all across America, projects that will deliver new, clean energy and strengthen our country's grid. We also—it's going to—there are also manufacturing tax credits as well in this bill to make products like solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage—make it right here in the United States of America.
And this is going to create thousands of good-paying jobs, apprenticeship opportunities, and manufacturing jobs for clean energy construction projects, solar projects, wind projects, clean hydrogen projects, carbon capture projects, and so much more.
And along with the CHIPS and Science Act that I'll be signing into law next week, the Inflation Reduction Act will mean we are making the largest investment ever in clean energy and American energy security—the largest in our history. It will be the largest investment American manufacturing—in American manufacturing as well.
Joining me today are the CEOs of some of the most iconic American manufacturing companies and the union leaders who represent America's manufacturing workers. They see how, already, because of our work over the last 18 months, American manufacturing is coming back stronger than ever. Where is it written that America can't lead in manufacturing in the world? Six hundred and thirteen thousand manufacturing jobs created just since I took office, the most created in three decades.
And with the investment in this bill, we are going to supercharge that recovery; make sure that the manufacturing, innovation, and jobs that come from this bill are made in America.
And third, this bill is going to reduce the deficit by another $300 billion. That's beyond the record $1.7 trillion we're on track to cut the deficit by just this year—this fiscal year.
And we're going to help pay for those critical needs from working families and our economy by asking corporations earning more than a billion dollars a year to pay a minimum tax of 15 percent. That's less than a schoolteacher and a auto worker pay.
Let me be clear: Despite what some folks are saying, the Inflation Reduction Act makes sure that no one earning less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in Federal taxes, notwithstanding all these ads you see on television.
But don't take my word for it. Nearly 130 economists, 7 Nobel laureates in economics, former Treasury Secretaries, the Federal Reserve Vice Chair, former Director of the Congressional Budget Office wrote that this bill will, quote, ""fight inflation and lower costs for American families while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly-shared long-term economic growth."" End of quote. So, you know, look at the facts.
So let me close with this: The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug prices, lowers health insurance premiums, invests in clean energy that will create jobs and economic opportunity for business and labor, reduces the deficit, and makes commonsense reforms to our corporate Tax Code. These are the facts.
One more thing. The Inflation Reduction Act has bipartisan support among the people of this country. Look at the polling data: The vast majority of people in America support what's in the Inflation Reduction Act. So my message to Congress is this: Listen to the American people.
This is the strongest bill you can pass to lower inflation, continue to cut the deficit, reduce health care costs, tackle the climate crisis, and promote America's energy security, all while reducing the burdens facing working class and middle class families.
Pass it. Pass it, and get it to my desk. Pass it for the American people. Pass it for businesses and workers. Pass it for America.
I'm going to stop here and turn this over to Brian Deese to start the meeting. But thank you. And thank you all for participating in this meeting. I really appreciate it.
National Economic Council Director Brian C. Deese. Thank you, Mr. President. And let me echo my thanks to all of you for joining us and for offering your perspective today. I just want to—we'll start right in and ask Jennifer, you, to start us off.
First of all, congratulations on the new role, and would really appreciate your perspective on the—from the manufacturing lens. Cummins, obviously iconic and long-serving American manufacturing company. And I'm told—you can confirm if this is true—that half of the diesel trucks on U.S. highways today are powered by Cummins engines.
And so we'd really just love to start off with your perspective on how this legislation, as well as the other efforts that we're working on together, affects your thinking about how to grow American manufacturing and, importantly, stay on the cutting edge of manufacturing innovation here.
Cummins Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer Jennifer Rumsey. Great. Well, thank you, Brian. And thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to be here today and speak in support of the Inflation Reduction Act and, in particular, the clean technology focus within that bill.
[At this point, Ms. Rumsey continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So we think these provisions make these new and low-carbon technologies more affordable, accelerating infrastructure development and deployment throughout the economy. And by reducing some of the cost gap between traditional power and these newer solutions, we can advance their viable—viability and make them a reality.
So thank you again for the opportunity to be here and to support the Inflation Reduction Act, which is good for the economy and the environment.
The President. Well, thank you. Is it all right if I ask a question, Brian? [Laughter]
Director Deese. Of course, Mr. President.
The President. The—first of all, you got me back and forth to Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington, DC, for a long time on Amtrak. Thank you.
Ms. Rumsey. You're welcome.
The President. Look, where we're going to make a big investment in clean technology manufacturing facilities, like the facilities that make electric vehicles—how important will this investment be in building out the electric vehicle supply chains? Because it seems to me that's one of the—I mean, everybody is looking at doing that. We seem to—I think we have enormous opportunity here.
Ms. Rumsey. Yes, I agree, Mr. President. There's a lot of work to build out those supply chains, to build out the infrastructure, to move to these new and a variety of different fuel and technology types. And we see a significant opportunity to increase U.S. manufacturing capacity and grow jobs here in all these different technologies that support our strategy—destination zero—to decarbonize our industry.
So we're excited for the opportunity to bring some of those solutions here to the U.S., export those technologies globally, increase America's economic competitiveness, as we focus on this.
And Cummins has done this before. We actually made diesel technology viable for commercial trucking applications. And we see the Inflation Reduction Act as one key piece of accelerating our journey and really transitioning our applications to technologies of the future like battery, fuel cell, electric, and green hydrogen.
The President. Well, I think you can do it. I really do. And I hope this is as helpful as we think it is, because you've always been in the forefront here.
And you know, the idea—it just—we—I keep trying to remind people, and I don't think I have to remind anybody on this Zoom—that there's not a damn thing we can't do when we set our mind to it. We have never failed in trying to break through, no matter what—I mean, over the last hundred years.
And I think this presents an enormous opportunity for a healthier environment, a cleaner environment, a cheaper environment for people to get by on.
And—any rate, I am really optimistic. And I want to thank you very much, Jennifer, for being willing to come and talk to us about it. Because we'll be talking——
Ms. Rumsey. My pleasure.
The President. If this passes, we'll be talking a lot more. [Laughter]
Ms. Rumsey. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President.
Director Deese. So, Mr. President, I was going to ask—we'll go from heavy-duty commercial to light-duty vehicles.
And, Mary, thank you for being here. And just wanted to get your perspective on, you know, broadly, the automotive sector and the manufacturing opportunity that you see here, and how this bill and the other things we're working on will affect your perspective on where we can take the sector in this country.
The President. Am I on mute?
General Motors Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mary T. Barra. Great. Well, Brian, thank you. And, Mr. President, thank you as well. I, today, am at one of——
The President. Hey, Mary, by the way——
Ms. Barra. ——our manufacturing——
The President. ——we owe you big. You started all this. I remember our conversation. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. I am serious.
Ms. Barra. Yes, well, we're working hard. And I'm actually at one of our manufacturing facilities in Ohio today. And I'm very pleased to participate on behalf of GM and to have the opportunity to add GM's voice in support of the Inflation Reduction Act as currently proposed.
And, Mr. President, I also want to thank you for your leadership. Your engagement with congressional leaders and a broad set of stakeholders over the last year, I believe, has really helped us get to this point.
At GM, we believe we are at an inflection point and one that, as we take these steps, we could create a much brighter future for America. You know, as we talked about the transition to an all-electric future, Mr. President, you saw what General Motors saw and continues to see. And it's the opportunity to create and maintain good-paying American jobs and the opportunity for America to lead in electrification and innovation.
General Motors is committed—we've already announced historic investments in the United States. This bill will help drive further investments in American manufacturing and sustainable, scalable, and secure supply chains. And all that comes with that is a stronger economy and job growth.
So we deeply appreciate also the inclusion of the EV provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. While some of the goals cannot be achieved overnight, we are confident that the significant investments GM is making in manufacturing, in the workforce, in our infrastructure, in supply chains, and in clean energy will establish the U.S. as a global leader today and in the future.
So, once again, thank you for the opportunity to voice our support for the Inflation Reduction Act.
Director Deese. Thank you, Mary.
And I wanted to just bring Liz, you, in here too. You said recently that this bill was—your focus here was on real solutions for working families, and I'm hoping you could give us your perspective from the—kind of, the ground-level view, from the families and workers that you're talking to and engaging with, how you see this piece of legislation intersecting with their needs and their priorities.
AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler. Absolutely. Thank you, Brian.
Hello, everyone. I, too, want to start by thanking President Biden and the administration for your commitment to American manufacturing and, of course, for inviting us to be a part of this conversation today. I think it's a great mix of labor and business leaders, and it shows how important and historic the Inflation Reduction Act is.
[Ms. Shuler continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So we are united in support for this legislation. We urge Congress to move it quickly, get it passed, and signed into law. Get it to the President to sign.
Thank you.
The President. Can you unmute me?
White House aide. You're unmuted.
The President. Hey, Liz, thanks. And Mary. You guys are a hell of a team—what's going on.
You know, one of the things that—and you heard me say this before: My dad used to have an expression. He'd say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.'""
The only way we're going to be able to do that for American workers is to make sure that we continue to grow and create good-paying jobs. And that's what you're doing, and that's what the AFL-CIO is doing with Liz, making sure that we can talk about the impact this relief is going to have on American workers.
In addition to—and by the way, I'm looking at a card here, reminding myself that it's going to cut energy costs and unlock $500 on average annually for energy savings; 30-percent tax credit for home energy systems like rooftop and solar and efficient windows; $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 tax credit for used ones; $14,000 for consumer rebate for high-efficiency appliances, like electric heat pumps.
It's going to do an awful lot beyond what is the overall piece here about lowering inflation. And you know, in addition to the new jobs it's going to create in this bill, the Inflation Reduction Act is also going to bring down energy and health care costs for all Americans, and it's going to impact on—this relief it will have on the American workers is real.
Liz, do your folks talk about that? Do we talk about how it's going to actually, you know, reduce health care costs, prescription drug costs, et cetera?
Ms. Shuler. Absolutely, Mr. President. I would say that that is what's most on people's mind, is, you know, can they afford to pay their health care premiums; can they afford to put food on the table for their families. And so bringing down costs for workers is exactly what we need in this moment, and that's what this bill does.
And so I know Ray Curry is on here with me. That's exactly what we're trying to do, is get the message out there. Because as you know, there's often a disconnect in what happens in Washington to what happens at the grassroots and community level. So that's our job as, you know, leaders in the labor movement and working with our members and working people every single day to make sure people recognize what this bill is going to do and—so that they see the impact in their communities and in their wallets.
The President. And, Mary, what General Motors is doing I find absolutely amazing. Your commitment to moving toward clean energy and commitment to electric vehicles, about being able to meet the 2050 international standard, et cetera. And you're going do it before then.
And I just think that General Motors is—can play a gigantic role, and other companies around the world are going to follow, because you're going to be leading the world.
One of the things that I did, I must admit in total disclosure: I've spoken to the chairwoman about the possibility of my being able to buy one of those Corvettes that are electric vehicles that—you know, when they come out. And I'm not going to be able to do it because I can't drive a vehicle while I'm Vice President—while I'm President any more than I could when I was Vice President.
But I think we can change the face of the country with this legislation and reduce inflation, not increase it.
Mary, do you have any closing comment you want to make?
Ms. Barra. Just that, Mr. President, I completely agree with you. I couldn't be more excited about the EV portfolio that General Motors is in the midst of launching. Our first battery plant is coming online in a matter of weeks in Ohio. We have another plant next year and the following year, both in the U.S.—and we're about ready to announce our fourth—as well as converting plants and making sure that we maintain and grow the jobs that we have in this country.
So, you know, it is happening. We're at this critical juncture right now. And I think this Inflation Reduction Act will be part of the catalyst that helps us move forward. So thank you.
The President. Well, you guys are doing a heck of a job. I really mean it. I want to thank you very, very much.
I know there's—more people that want to speak, and we're going to hear more. But I just can't tell you how much I think you have collectively moved—this whole movement of getting to clean energy, creating jobs—jobs that are increasing environmental protection, and reducing everything from drug prices on, matters.
This is one of those inflection points in history. And you all are at the forefront of it, all of you on the screen. We haven't gotten even to most of you yet.
But again, thank you both very, very much. Appreciate it.
Director Deese. And, Mr. President, on the topic of drug prices and health care prices as well, I wanted to bring Greg Adams in.
And you're serving, actively now, I think, 12 million patients and close to 2 million Medicare beneficiaries. And so we'd love your perspective on the health care elements of this, particularly in light of what both the President and Liz Shuler said about it being top of mind to people—health care premiums, drug pricing. And I want to get your perspective.
Kaiser Permanente Chair and Chief Executive Officer Greg A. Adams. Thank you, Brian. And thank you, Mr. President. I join my colleagues in saying it's a pleasure to be here today, to have the opportunity to discuss the importance and the urgency of the Inflation Reduction Act.
[Mr. Adams continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So, as one of the Nation's largest not-for-profit health plans and care delivery systems, each of these issues have a direct impact on our members, our patients, and our communities, and are critical to our ability to carry out our mission to provide high-quality, affordable care, and to ensure that we're helping improve the health of the communities that we—with which we're in and we serve.
So we join our colleagues in encouraging Congress to act without delay to bring the benefits of this important legislation to the American people.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Brian, are you going to——
Director Deese. Yes.
The President. I've got a question, unless you—why don't you go ahead first?
Director Deese. Well, Mr. President, I was going to just turn briefly, before we get to our other speakers, to just ask Secretary Yellen to offer——
The President. Before you do, can I ask a question?
Director Deese. Sure, of course.
The President. I'd like to ask a question. First of all, Greg, thank you very much. You—it's astounding the number of people you service every day. And one of the goals of this bill is to keep drug prices and—while still allowing drug manufacturers to be rewarded appropriately and for providing real innovation.
Mr. Adams. Right.
The President. Do you think it—do you think this meets that balance of both? Because, look, the last thing I want to do is—I don't want to see there be a disincentive by drug companies to not seek answers to some of the diseases that they're trying to deal with. And so they have to be compensated, but they're being incredibly well compensated now. And from my perspective, I don't think that this upsets the balance of making significant profit, at the same time providing breakthroughs and innovation. What's your sense of it?
Mr. Adams. Yes, thank you, Mr. President. I do—I think it does maintain the balance. The bill looks at the high costs of specialty drugs. Specialty drugs are a key component of the high drug costs. They actually account for a small percentage of prescriptions, but they are now at a point where they make up over half of our pharmacy costs, impacting the whole population.
So the bill looks at a limited number of specialty drugs, actually calls for a negotiation of prices at a point after these drugs have been on the market.
I, as the CEO of Kaiser Permanente, will still be responsible and committed to using market forces to help keep the majority of other drugs affordable and accessible. So I don't see this as interfering. I think it carefully frames the balance that's needed.
So I think the answer to your question is: Yes, I think the balance is here, and I think there's plenty of room for innovation and for market forces to be at play.
The President. Thank you very much.
Brian, back to you.
Director Deese. Great. Thank you, Mr. President.
And before we get to Ray and David and Warner, I just wanted to ask Secretary Yellen to just zoom out for a minute and give us your take of the overall economics, particularly at the moment we find ourselves in the recovery.
Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. Thank you, Brian. And thank you, Mr. President. I'm really excited to be here today to talk with leaders from both business and labor about how important it is for Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.
Actually, I convened business leaders myself yesterday to discuss this important legislation. It will address the cost of prescription drugs and health care for millions of Americans, lower energy costs, bolster our energy security so we don't have to rely on autocrats like Putin.
This would be the biggest investment in fighting climate change in our country's history. And this isn't just going to protect us from global energy shocks, like we've seen from Russia's illegal invasion. It's also going to create good-paying jobs across our country to power that work.
I also think it's important to talk about the revenue streams that make these investments possible. And that means adequately funding the Internal Revenue Service so they can enforce our existing tax laws.
The vast majority of businesses and workers are playing by the rules, but some aren't. And estimates show that the tax gap from the top 1 percent of earners alone is as much as $160 billion each year. Making sure we have the resources to ensure the wealthiest among us can't avoid paying the taxes they owe, that's about restoring basic fairness and ending a two-tiered system. It's about making sure we can invest in addressing those key household expenses and making our economy stronger.
I think it's important to underscore that this legislation is fiscally responsible. It will actually reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars over time. And by reducing deficits, we'll be complementing the work the Federal Reserve and the administration is doing to combat inflation, even as we address these cost pressures like health care, prescription drugs, and energy.
So that's why I hope Congress will pass this bill as soon as possible. And it's why you saw five of my predecessors of the Treasury Department—Secretaries who served under Democrats and under Republicans—call for the same this week.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you, Janet.
Director Deese. Thank you. Thank you, Janet.
And, Mr. President, we're going to conclude the open press portion of this event and shift into the next section here.

"August 03, 2022",Remarks at a Meeting of the Interagency Task Force on Reproductive Health Care Access ,"The President. Thank you, Vice President Harris, for leading today's meeting. And thanks to you, all of you, especially Health and Human Services Secretary Becerra and Director of the Gender Policy Council Jen Klein for cochairing this Task Force, and Attorney General Garland, Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, and Veterans Affairs Secretary McDonough for your work on this Task Force to protect access to a woman's right to choose reproductive health care in the wake of the Supreme Court's extreme decision on wiping out a 50-year constitutional precedent of Roe v. Wade.
You know, I created this task force by Executive order last month and—to ensure that every part of the Federal Government does its part at this critical moment where women's health and lives are on the line amidst chaos and uncertainty unleashed by this decision.
Emergency medical care being denied to women experiencing miscarriages. Doctors uncertain about what they can do to provide for their patients. Pharmacists unsure whether they can fill prescriptions that they've always filled before. A tragic case of rape survivors, including a 10-year-old girl, forced to travel to another State for care.
You know, and wiping out the right to choose on—whether you have incest, abortion—I mean, excuse me, incest or having a rape or—I mean, it just—this is just extreme. You know, even the life of the mother is in question in some cases—in some States.
Republicans in Congress and their extreme MAGA ideology are determined to go even further, talking about nationwide bans on—that would outlaw abortion in every State, under every circumstance, going after the broader right to privacy as well. But as I've said before, this fight is not over. And we saw that last night in Kansas.
In the opinion of people on—in the opinion of the Dobbs case, the extreme majority of the Supreme Court wrote, ""women""—this is a quote from that case—""women are not without electoral or political power."" Unquote. The Court practically dared the women in this country to go to the ballot box and restore the right to choose that the Court had just ripped away after 50 years
And, as I said last night—last month, I don't think the Court has any notion, for that matter—or the Republican Party, for that matter—to decide that—how far to press their extreme agenda and how women are going to respond. They don't have a clue about the power of American women.
Last night, in Congress—in Kansas, they found out. Women and men did exercise their electoral and political power. With a record turnout, voters of Kansas defeated a ballot initiative to remove the right to choose an abortion from the Kansas constitution. It was in the Kansas constitution. They're trying to strike it and eliminate it from the Kansas constitution.
In a decisive vote, in a decisive victory, voters made it clear that politicians should not interfere with the fundamental rights of women. And the voters of Kansas sent a powerful signal that this fall, the American people will vote to preserve and protect their right and refuse to let them be ripped away by politicians. And my administration has their back.
You know, today I'm signing a second Executive order—I'm about to sign—that responds to the health care crisis that has unfolded since the Supreme Court overturned Roe and that women are facing all across America. The health care crisis is—you know, it's just—it's hard for me to even under—understand how they think this. The health care crisis is, women can't get—can't choose, can't get an abortion even in a case of incest, even in the case of rape.
But it goes beyond that. There are a lot of women who take prescriptions prescribed by their doctors and have been taking for some time for other conditions—for arthritis, for epilepsy, for Crohn's disease. And in many cases, these prescriptions are not being filled.
Say a 25-year-old woman—her doctor prescribes medication for her epilepsy. He's been doing it for a while. She goes to the pharmacy. The pharmacist won't fill the prescription because the same medicine could also cause a miscarriage. So if she's not getting the medicine she needs for her epilepsy whether she's pregnant or not. A pharmacy has no right to do that.
Just yesterday, in Idaho, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to make sure that pregnant women facing serious threats to their health can get the medical care they need in Medicare-funded emergency rooms. Under Federal law, no woman—whether pregnant or not, no matter where she lives—should be turned away or denied necessary treatment during a medical crisis. The Justice Department stepped in to make sure that this extreme State law criminalizing abortion does not put women's health and lives at risk in these situations.
You know, this Executive order also helps women travel out of State for medical care. Secretary Becerra is going to work with States through the Medicaid to allow them to provide reproductive health care for women who live in States where abortions are being banned in that State.
The Executive order makes sure health care providers comply with Federal law so women don't face delays or denials of medically necessary care. And this Executive order advances research and data collection to evaluate the impact that this reproductive health crisis is having on maternal health and other health conditions and outcomes.
This Executive order builds on the first one I signed last month that created this Task Force in the first place and that also will help safeguard access to health care, including the right to choose and contraception. It promotes safety and security of clinics, patients, and providers. It protects patients' privacy and access to accurate information.
Let me close with this: Beyond the actions you're taking, I know that, along with Kamala, many of you have been traveling the country listening to women, health care providers, legal experts, State and local officials and legislators, and others so that we are doing all we can in my administration to protect the rights of—health and safety of the people in this country. You know, their perspectives are going to inform the work of this Task Force and the recommendations you make to me.
I believe Roe got it right, and it has been the law for close to 50 years. And I commit to the American people that we're doing everything in our power to safeguard access to health care, including the right to choose that women had under Roe v. Wade, which was ripped away by this extreme Court.
But ultimately, Congress must codify the protections of Roe as Federal law. And if Congress fails to act, the people of this country need to elect Senators and Representatives who will restore Roe and will protect the right to privacy, freedom, and equality.
I'll stop there and turn this over to the Vice President. There's so much more to say, but I'm anxious to hear from all of you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Do I sign this order now? I'm going to sign this Executive order right now, okay?
[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]
Okay, folks, we've got a lot of work to do. But, Madam Vice President, I'm sure you can get it done sitting there with all those folks.
Thank you.
I wish I were with you in person, quite frankly. But I'm getting there.
You're on mute. I can't hear you.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. We feel your presence, Mr. President. [Laughter]
The President. [Laughter] Well, I wish I were——
Vice President Harris. Thank you.
The President. Thank you.
Vice President Harris. Well, President Joe Biden has set the tone for our administration from the very beginning—from the time that an opinion was leaked, to the time the Dobbs decision came down.
And our President has been a leader in saying that the women of America should be protected; their right to make decisions about their own bodies should be a matter that we all defend, understanding that the government should not be in the business of making those decisions for the women of America.
Our administration has been very clear, as is clear by the leaders who are at this table, that we trust the judgment of the women of America to make decisions based on what they know is in their best interests. We trust the women of America to make those decisions, if she chooses, in consultation with her faith leader, with her physician, with her loved one. But we understand fully the government should not be making that decision for her.
And it is with that spirit that the President has convened this Task Force of these leaders to ensure that we have a whole-of-Government approach to our work, understanding that every day in America—especially with these extremist so-called ""leaders"" in States passing these laws, some of which will criminalize health care providers and punish women—that we do everything in our power and our ability, based on our role, to ensure that we protect the women of America around some of the most intimate decisions that any human being can make.
So it is with that spirit and purpose that we convene and we meet. We will be engaged in an in-depth discussion about the role of the various agencies and the Cabinet members and their roles of leadership around this important issue.
As the President said, the people of Kansas spoke yesterday, and they spoke loud and clear. They said this is not a partisan issue. The women of America should not be the subject of partisan debate or perspective.
The people of Kansas spoke and said this is a matter of defense of basic principles of liberty and freedom in America. And they spoke loudly in saying that they trust women to make decisions about their own lives and their bodies. And they said government should not be mandating those decisions for the women of America. So today we are prepared to do the work that is necessary. We will discuss what we have done so far as an administration, and we will discuss what we are prepared to do going forward.
I have been traveling the country in recent weeks, talking with, in particular, community-based leaders, health care providers, State legislatures and legislators. I've convened faith-based leaders. We have convened disability rights activists, people from various sectors of our country to talk about this issue.
And I will tell you: People are scared. When they look at these laws that are being passed and they understand what it means for themselves or someone they love, they are concerned. They are confused.
When you look at a map—which I have here somewhere—in terms of what this means in our country—and I don't have the map at the moment—[laughter]. My staff will tell me where that map is at the moment. [Laughter] But what we know is that there is a need for clarity around the rights of individuals and States in this moment.
And so General Merrick Garland will talk about what the Department of Justice is prepared to do. We know that there are concerns about the kind of support that is available in terms of federal resources to the various States that are protecting the rights of women and what our administration can do to support that.
We will be discussing what we need to do to address the profound misinformation and disinformation that is out there and can only thrive in an environment where there is confusion about what is the right approach and what is the law.
So these are some of the topics that we will be discussing. But, again, all convened with an understanding and an appreciation for the fact that this, as the President has said, represents a health care crisis in America where women, every day in our country, whoever they voted for in any election, understand what is at stake for themselves, their family, and their future.
And so, with that, I thank all of the leaders who are here. I look forward to our discussion. And because I promised that I have a map, I'm going to now show you that map.
[The Vice President held up a color-coded map of the United States.]
And you don't need to necessarily be able to read the words on the map, but you can see the color-coding, to understand this map represents our current assessment of the various laws that exist right now in these United States of America—different approaches in different States to this issue, which some might argue has been, by design, to intentionally confuse people about their rights.
But what, in fact, it has done without any question is made clear that the President's leadership, the leadership of the President's Cabinet and all of us at this table is critically necessary at this moment.
So, with that, I thank everyone for being here. And I will now turn it over to our—the head of our Gender Policy Council, Jen Klein. Thank you.

"July 28, 2022",Remarks in a Virtual Roundtable Discussion With Business Leaders on the National Economy ,"The President. Hello, folks. Can they hear me up on the stage there?
Well, let me begin by saying I apologize for being a little late. There's a vote going on right now that I've a mild interest in. [Laughter] And I apologize for keeping you waiting.
First of all, I want to thank the CEOs from some of America's leading companies, from technology to financial services, to travel and retail. And I'm—we're hear—I'm going to—we'll hear directly about the outlook for their businesses in the economy, from their perspective, and how we transition from a historic economic recovery to a stable, steady growth and lower inflation, without letting go of all the historic gains we've made over the last 18 months.
But before we get started, I want to say two things about the GDP report we received this morning. First, it's important to start with what we know before this morning's report. Our job market remains historically strong. Our economy created more than 9 million jobs since I came to office, in no small part because of the people on this stage. Our economy created more than 1 million jobs in the second quarter, the same period as today's GDP report covers. And our unemployment rate is 3.6 percent, near a record historic low.
Secondly, households and businesses—the engines of our economy—continue to move forward. Just this past week, SK Group from Korea was here at the White House to announce $22 billion in new investment in semiconductors, advanced batteries, and electric vehicle chargers, and medical devices. That's on top of the $200 billion in clean energy investments in America from other businesses since we took office. All powering the strongest rebound in American manufacturing in three decades.
Now, there's no doubt we expect growth to be slower last—than last year, and—for the rapid clip we had. But that's consistent with a transition to a stable, steady growth and lower inflation. There's going to be a lot of chatter today on Wall Street and among pundits about whether we are in a recession.
But if you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment, we see signs of economic progress in the second quarter as well. And yesterday's Fed Chairman—the Fed Chairman Powell said—made it clear that he doesn't think the U.S. economy is currently in a recession. He said, quote, ""There are too many areas"" of economic—where ""the economy [is] performing too well."" He said ""too"" well—T-O-O. Too well. [Laughter]
He pointed to the labor market as an example. The best thing we can do right now is put our economy in a better position to make the transition to stable, steady growth for Congress to—and is—steady, stable growth is for Congress to act; that's the best thing we can do. They're voting right now, as I said.
I applaud—the bipartisan effort to get the CHIPS Act to my desk to sign into law, which would advance our Nation's competitiveness and technological edge by boosting our domestic semiconductor production and manufacturing.
Another Congress should do with—another thing that Congress should do is to pass the Inflation Reduction Act to lower prescription drug costs, which would reduce the deficit, I might add, and help ease inflationary pressures and ensure that 13 million Americans can continue to save an average of $800 per year in their health care premiums.
Both of these bills are going to help the economy continue to grow, bring down inflation, and make sure we aren't giving up on all the significant progress we've made in the last year.
I'm going to stop there and begin the meeting. But thanks to the CEOs for joining me. And let me start with you, Brian. And thanks for taking all my phone calls, pal. [Laughter] The Bank of America.
I want to ask you a question: Your bank serves many Americans across the country. What are you seeing right now in terms of financial health of your consumers? What's the bank records tell you about the financial health?
Bank of America Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan. Well, thank you, Mr. President. It's good to see you recovering. [Laughter]
The President. Thanks.
Mr. Moynihan. But, at Bank of America, we have, you know, 60 million consumers and 35 million core checking accounts for Americans. And so a couple of key points: Number one, they're spending more money. Through the first 25 days of July 2022, they have spent 10 percent more than they spent in July of 2021, the first 25 days. And that's consistent with what we saw in the whole second quarter in earlier this year.
[At this point Mr. Moynihan continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So right now they're doing what we want them to do, which is being employed. Some of the stresses in the system—there's no discounting that, and we're trying to help all those customers through this stress. But that stress has been mitigated by the work that your administration, prior administrations, did to help people through the pandemic and also just the strong employment that you spoke about.
The President. Well, Brian, thanks a lot. I really do appreciate your—and thanks for always being available for your input. I appreciate it a great deal.
And now I have a question for the CEO of Marriott, who is very disappointed to hear they're investing in travel. [Laughter] It's of great concern to Tony.
It's—Tony—[laughter]—the travel and hospitality industry is experiencing and did experience tremendous hardship during the pandemic. But the recovery now is experiencing—is a very different experience. It's—things look really up for your industry right now.
And what would—how would you describe the industry today? And how do you see the path of demand through the end of the year? I know that's—you can't know—nothing is guaranteed, but what's your sense?
Marriott International Chief Executive Officer Anthony Capuano. Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the invitation today. I think what we've learned over the last couple quarters is really the resilience of travel. And when we look at our forward-booking data, we see real evidence of that resilience.
And what's interesting, we think about our business through three demand segments: leisure, business travel, and group. The recovery has clearly been led by leisure. And in fact, last year, leisure demand got back to where we were prepandemic. But what's encouraging is we're seeing real recovery in the other two segments. Business transience has been a slower recover—recovery, but as we see more and more folks returning to the office, we see continued improvement. And maybe the biggest surprise has been the pace at which group demand has come back. And we——
The President. Group demand?
Mr. Capuano. Group, correct. And we fully expected social group to recover quickly with all of the canceled weddings and bar mitzvahs and family reunions. But now we're seeing strong and consistent recovery in business group travel as well. So quite encouraging.
[Mr. Capuano continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And maybe I'll just close by thanking your administration and, in particular, Secretary Raimondo for your work to eliminate the inbound international testing requirement. We think that's going to be very impactful in the travel and tourism sector. And in fact, the U.S. Travel Association just came out and said they expect the direct impact of that change to be an incremental, more than 5 million visitors to the U.S. in the balance of this year, spending more than $9 billion.
The President. Well, that—I mean, that sounds pretty encouraging overall, not just for this summer, but looking forward.
One of the things I want to ask you about is that the—obviously, the pandemic had a profound negative impact. But right now, as I look out there—and I've traveled around the world a lot of late, going to various conferences—there seems to be a willingness or an inclination for business to travel more.
To—instead of everybody sitting and Zooming everything, it seems to me, in-person movement of personnel and businesses around the country—and I see it more around the world, quite frankly—seems to be on the up. Is that accurate, or is that just a perception?
Mr. Capuano. It is, Mr. President. And in fact, we see two principal drivers. I think, number one, businesses that are customer-facing—consulting firms, law firms, accounting firms—they will tell you that the best way for them to optimize their business is to be in person, embedded in their customers' offices every day.
The President. Yes.
Mr. Capuano. And I think the last few years have reminded us of the power of in-person interaction.
The other thing we see is rapidly growing demand for training. Many employers across this country rely heavily on the strength of their corporate culture. And as they're hiring thousands of new employees, it's really hard to immerse those employees in a culture via Teams or Zoom. And so the demand we see rising for in-person training has been quite significant.
The President. Well, I don't want to get off on this. Corning would know something about this. But there's so many new jobs on the horizon in the tech-related field that the need to train personnel to be able to handle these jobs is totally within our capacity, but it's needed. It's not like it's on-the-job training for a lot of these things.
And so one of the things we're looking at—our economic team, Secretary—is how we engage everything from community colleges to other entities to train people for the need that exists in that community—in that community.
And so it's totally consistent with what you're saying, because there are going to be—and we're talking about potentially a lot of jobs. I mean, we're talking about thousands of jobs. And—but again, a lot of it requires some, you know, training; it's not all on-the-job training.
Well, I'm—thank you very much for talking to me about that, Tony. And——
Mr. Capuano. Thank you.
The President. And now I—what I'd like to do is—there's an outfit called Corning. Right, Wendell? [Laughter] And you're the CEO of a great company.
And look, you know, we've seen an inflection point in U.S. manufacturing over the last—the last year. And by that I mean—you know, I can recall in the last administration—I'm not criticizing the last administration—the previous 4 years—and even at the end of our administration, Obama-Biden, the question was: ""Are we still going to be the manufacturing hub of the world? Are we still—you know, are we—in manufacturing, where are we going to sit? We're going to do all these other things, but what about manufacturing?""
And—and so you've seen, in that inflection point, manufacturing in the U.S. Can you describe for me what you're seeing at Corning? What's your outlook on the manufacturing sector? Talk to me a little bit about that, if you could.
Corning Inc. Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Wendell P. Weeks. Sure, Mr. President. First of all, you're right: The last 18 months has been tremendous growth for U.S. manufacturing. And we've seen that in our results. And that continues, but there's some subtle things going on as well. We just did our quarter two earnings, so the numbers are fresh in my mind.
[Mr. Weeks continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
Think smartphones. Smartphones in quarter two were down about 11 percent year over year. So pretty strongly. Auto—been depressed for a long time, mostly on supply chain basis. Demand has been there. But there's interesting signals in global demand. In April, there were zero cars sold in Shanghai. Okay?
The President. Zero?
Mr. Weeks. Zero. COVID lockdowns. But zero is a really low number, right?
The President. No, I—yes.
Mr. Weeks. I mean. [Laughter] In Europe—[laughter].
The President. COVID lockdown or not. [Laughter]
Mr. Weeks. In Europe, in June, we had the lowest number of new car registrations that we've seen since 1996. So we're a global player. So it's the whole global economy, so it's harder for us to, you know, pick on what is in the U.S., Europe, Asia.
[Mr. Weeks continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
Solar demand we see going forward unabated, and we'll also expand in that. But consumer seems soft to us.
The President. Yes. Well, you know, one of the things that—my father was in the automobile business his whole life. Ran a major dealership, a General Motors dealership. And you know, growing up as a kid, you knew whether cars were selling or not—[laughter]—based on tuition or whatever things.
But all kidding aside, I was—I knew, but I never had tried to visualize, how critical the high-quality computer chips were for an automobile. And a significant part of the slowdown that occurred when it hit is inflation—the cost of automobiles—because people are not buying them, also because they cost so damn—and there's so few of them. They're not manufacturing nearly what they were able to manufacture in the past because of the fact of these lack of computer chips.
But it's not just automobiles; it's anything—you know, phones, cell phones—a whole range of—whereas, I found it interesting you talking about how, you know, on the fiberoptic piece, that is moving. But how much of that do you think is related to the fact that we put in an infrastructure bill that provided billions of dollars for connecting the internet, for having the ability to access the internet because we're making it available, quite frankly, with all the money we're spending to make it available to every home in America, every neighborhood?
I mean, I'm not sure I'm asking the question properly. I think you know what I'm trying to get at.
Mr. Weeks. Yes.
The President. So talk to me about the difference: demand relating to where we fund it—and we're talking the fiber optics needed to deal with everything from solar to broadband in communities that don't have it now.
I mean, one of the things I found was that—and the four of us have talked about this a lot—five of us have talked about this—is, you know, in the middle of the pandemic, seeing—going by a McDonald's and seeing a bunch of families sitting out there in the parking lot not eating a hamburger, but connecting to the internet because they had no access to internet so their kid could get access to the schooling they needed.
So talk to me a little bit about how much of this is driven by the inability to afford it or the lack of desire to get it, and how much is driven by, when the Government is invested in it, it makes a difference. I'm not sure I'm asking the question. You know what I'm talking about.
Mr. Weeks. I totally understand your question, Mr. President. It's a very good question. So the direct impact of the BEAD program, or the Government effort to connect the unconnected, in this year, direct impact is very low. That really starts to come into its power next year.
But there's also an indirect impact, which is the commitment of the Government and of the administration to making sure we build the infrastructure that's required. Really does make a difference in the behavior of all the players.
The President. Yes.
Mr. Weeks. So what we're seeing, though, is just strong demand from our carrier customers, because they want to be the ones that connect folks.
The President. Yes
Mr. Weeks. And they're building out 5G, new tech, which needs a lot more fiber optics than 4G. And then cloud computing also needs a lot more fiber.
[Mr. Weeks continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
But if that goes through, you can expect that to trigger not just the direct Government piece, but by providing that leadership, others will come in with much more serious money—right?—to be able to magnify it. So it has—it's hard to answer your question. It's a great question, but it's a very subtle effect.
The President. Well, I think you've answered it, because one of the things the Secretary has talked about is that when the Government is in on something that everyone acknowledges is useful and needed, like, you know, the fiberoptic changes, then everybody goes, ""Well, maybe""—
[A White House aide handed the President a note.]
You're trying to tell me something, huh?
Oh, so far, we've got 217 ""yes"" votes for the CHIPS bill, and the House has passed it. [Applause]
Sorry for the interruption.
But, Madam Secretary, talk a little bit about what private-sector attitudes change, if they do, if the United States—if the Government is taking a risk and a chance on betting on by putting their dollars where their—their money where their mouth is, in terms of what needs to be done.
Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo. Yes. First of all, congratulations. That is huge. I don't want to——
The President. We've been trying a long time. [Laughter]
Secretary Raimondo. Yes, we have been. And you—the President has been amazing in his leadership on this. So thank you. Thank you.
This is——
The President. You can tell I'm a lawyer. I don't know anything about anything. [Laughter]
Secretary Raimondo. You know how to lead. And that makes a difference.
This is a perfect example: semiconductors. I mean, the private sector is waiting for a signal, and they want predictability. There's nothing that unlocks private capital like predictability. So when the—right? I mean, when the Government steps up and says, ""We're going to invest in infrastructure, solar, chips,"" it provides predictability and investments. And I—it will encourage, I think, a lot of private-sector capital to follow along.
Not to mention the fact that what we're investing in—semiconductors, broadband, roads, bridges, solar—we need this. You know? We need this to compete, as we talk about. So I think it's very significant.
The President. I'm taking too much time asking you all these questions, but you're—I have great interest in your—can I ask, Janet—Secretary Yellen—how would you characterize now—and you've been very, very straightforward in your views on everything—how would you characterize the health of the economy now?
Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I think I would say let's first look back at the trajectory of the economy over the last 18 months. During that period, the United States has experienced an historic economic recovery. There were 9 million jobs created—over 9 million last year. And we saw the fastest single-year decline in unemployment in our historic record.
[Secretary Yellen continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And I believe that in the months to come, with skill and luck, it will be possible to maintain that strength, particularly the strength we enjoy in the labor market, while easing the tightness that has been driving inflation.
The President. Well, you know, there's an old expression. A baseball coach of the Dodgers, years ago—Leo Durocher—said, ""I'd rather have Lady Luck sitting on my bench than skill."" [Laughter] My grandfather, who was an All-American football player at Santa Clara in the turn of the century, he'd say, ""No, I'd rather have luck and skill on the bench."" [Laughter] So we're looking for both.
Secretary Yellen. We're looking for both.
The President. Let me just say, before I yield to you, Brian, and we can move on to the rest of the folks here: It's interesting and totally understandable why the vast majority of the American people have no idea what the recovery plan did, what the Government did at all.
I mean, the reason why we still had teachers in school, kids going to school, the reason why we had cops on the beat, reason why you had essential workers—States couldn't afford it, cities couldn't afford it, towns couldn't accord [afford]* it, counties couldn't afford it. So we came up with this Rescue Plan and gave them billions of dollars to keep the economy in their cities and towns and States moving.
And one of the things when I—and I fully understand it. Like I said, I was raised in one of those households where when the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was a topic of discussion around the kitchen table. And we weren't poor, we were just typical middle class family in a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop. But all kidding aside, it was—and we lived fine, but it was—it mattered. It mattered whether the price of gasoline went up.
One of the things that I find is—I look at and I take it very seriously the confidence level of the American people in the economy. And they're so down and they're looking—there's reason to be down, but I started thinking about it. And, Brian, you and I talked about it just a little bit. You know, the first year, we were able to, with the Rescue Plan, we were able to send them a check for 8 grand. I mean, a check. One—and beyond that, by the way; there was more than that.
But when you're making—if you're making 120 grand and you get a check for 8 grand, that's a lot of money. And so it helped—saved a lot of people, in terms of getting thrown out of their homes and rental housing and a whole range of things.
But I started thinking about it, just as, you know, somebody who was raised as a middle class kid. One year, even though you didn't have the job you have now, even though you didn't get a raise that year, the difference between having a job, having a 5-percent raise or whatever—3, 5, 7, whatever it happens to be—in the face of inflation, the price at the pump—although that's down every day so far. But you know, it's like, ""Whoa, I feel worse off."" But then again, I didn't get a check for 8 grand from the Government. They just—among other things. Does that make any sense to anybody, or is it just me?
Secretary Yellen. Well, it really makes a huge difference, Mr. President, because, as you said, it kept food on the table, helped people take care of their kids, especially at a time when many were out of school and it was hard to work. And the spending it generated put people back to work.
And you know, as I mentioned, we've seen the long—you know, the biggest stretch of job creation that got America back to work. And we need to bring down inflation, but we need to preserve the success that that plan achieved in the labor market.
The President. I know you're all busy as the devil, especially the folks who haven't had a chance to speak yet. I'm sorry I have so many questions, but I have great respect for your collective judgment here.
Brian, I'm yielding to you. I'm going to shush up.
National Economic Council Director Brian C. Deese. Yes, we're going to transition here and move the press out.

"July 28, 2022","Remarks on Legislation To Combat Inflation, Promote Clean Energy Production, and Reduce Prescription Drug Costs ","The President. Good afternoon. Yesterday I spoke with both Senator Schumer and Manchin and offered my support for a historic agreement to fight inflation and lower costs for American families. It's called the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Some of you will see a lot of similarities between the beginning—[laughter]—of the Build Back Better initiative. It's not all of it, but we've moved a long way.
I'll be going into detail in a minute. But simply put, the bill will lower health care costs for millions of Americans. It will—and it will be the most important investment—not hyperbole—the most important investment that we've ever made in our energy security, and developing cost savings and job-creating clean energy solutions for the future. It's a big deal.
It will also, for the first time in a long time, begin to restore fairness to the Tax Code—begin to restore fairness—by making the largest corporate nations—the largest corporations in America pay their fair share, with any—without any new taxes on people making under $400,000 a year.
Experts—even some experts who have criticized my administration in the past—agree that this bill—this bill—will reduce inflationary pressures on the economy. This bill will, in fact, reduce inflationary pressure on the economy.
It's a bill that costs—will cut your cost of living and reduce inflation for—and it lowers the deficit. It strengthens our economy for—in the long run as well.
This bill has won the support of climate leaders like former Vice President Al Gore who said the bill is, quote, ""long overdue and a necessary step to ensure the United States takes decisive action on the climate crisis that helps our economy and provides leadership for the world by example.""
Inflation hawks like former Secretary of Treasury Larry Summers said, quote, ""This bill is fighting inflation."" Let me say it: ""This bill is fighting inflation.""
Progressive leaders like Senator Elizabeth Warren said, quote, this bill—""This is a bill that truly is about fighting inflation, bringing down the cost for families, and putting our country on a sounder economic footing.""
Here's how it works. First, the bill finally delivers on a promise that Washington has made for decades to the American people. We are giving Medicare—we're giving Medicare—the power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices, which means seniors and consumers will pay less for their prescription drugs. Medicare will save, in the process, about $290 billion.
And, in addition, it also changes the circumstances for people on Medicare by putting a cap of a maximum $2,000 a year. Is—they will have to pay no more than $2,000 a year, no matter how many prescriptions they have, for all their prescription drugs—which is especially important for people with cancer and long-term diseases. It's a Godsend. It will literally be a Godsend for many families.
Second, the bill locks in place lower health care premiums for the next 3 years for millions of families that get coverage under the Affordable Care Act. That will mean an average savings of $800 a year for 13 million people.
Third, it invests $369 billion—granted, I called for 500-plus—but it invests $369 billion to secure our energy future and to address the climate crisis, bringing down family energy bills by hundreds of dollars by providing working families tax credits. It gives folks rebates buy—to buy new and efficient appliances, to weatherize their homes, and tax credits for heat pumps and rooftop solar.
It also gives consumers a tax credit to buy any electric vehicle or fuel cell vehicle, new or used, and a tax credit for up to $7,500 if those vehicles were made in America.
This investment in environmental justice is real. It also provides tax credits that will create thousands of good-paying jobs—manufacturing jobs on clean energy construction projects, solar projects, wind projects, clean hydrogen projects, carbon capture projects, and more—by giving tax credits for those who build these projects here in America.
Now, let me be clear: This bill would be the most significant legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis and improve our energy security right away. And it will give us a tool to meet the climate goals that are set—that we've agreed to—by cutting emissions and accelerating clean energy. A huge step forward.
Fourth, this bill requires the largest corporations to begin to—begin to pay toward their fair share in taxes by putting in place a 15-percent corporate minimum tax. Now, I know you've never heard me say this before—it will come as a shock to you—[laughter]—but 55 of the Fortune 500 companies paid no Federal income tax in 2020.
I know you only heard me say that about 10,000 times. But the fact is, they paid no taxes on an income—collective income of over $40 billion. Well, guess what? This bill ends that. It's—they're going to have to pay a minimum of 15-percent tax on that $40 billion or whatever the number turns out to be.
Fifth, this package will reduce the Federal deficit by over $300 billion. Already, on my watch, the deficit has come down my first year by $350 billion and a record $1.7 trillion at the end of this fiscal year. Now, that—this bill is going keep that progress going. Yes, I'll say it again: This legislation will bring down the deficit. Bring down the deficit.
The sixth point I want to make is, this bill will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. And I promise—a promise I made during the campaign and one which that I—that I've kept.
Now, look, I know it can be—sometimes seem like nothing gets done in Washington. [Laughter] I know it never crossed any of your minds. But the work of the Government can be slow and frustrating and sometimes even infuriating. Then the hard work of hours and days and months from people who refuse to give up pays off. History is made. Lives are changed.
With this legislation, we're facing up to some of our biggest problems, and we're a taking a giant step forward as a nation. That didn't just happen on this inflation reduction bill. It also happened yesterday when the Senate made the bipartisan decision as a nation to invest in America's manufacturing technology of semiconductors and additional funding for basic research and development in the cutting-edge industries of the 21st century.
If the House passes this bill that I think Speaker—I want to thank Speaker Pelosi—I think she's going to get it done—for her leadership here. It has added to the benefit—it has the added benefit of creating tens of thousands of good-paying—additional good-paying jobs, lowering inflation.
It's going to give us the ability—the ability not only to compete with China for the future, but to lead the world and win the economic competition of the 21st century. You've heard me say a thousand times: We have to invest in research, development, and growth.
I hope that the House is going to pass this bill today. My plea is: Put politics aside. Get it done. We need to lower the cost of automobiles, appliances, smart phones, consumer electronics, and so much more. And you can't do it—all of these things are powered—almost everything is in our lives is powered by these semiconductors and tiny computer chips the size of a fingernail tip.
Look, we should pass this today and get moving.
I know the compromise on the inflation bill doesn't include everything that I've been pushing for since I got to office. For example, I'm going to keep fighting for—in the future to bring down the cost of things for working families and middle class families that matter by providing for affordable and accessible things like affordable childcare; affordable eldercare; preschool—the cost of preschool; housing; keeping students with the cost—helping students with the cost of college; closing the health care coverage gap—you know, that's a fancy way of saying—""the health care coverage gap""—expanding Medicaid in States that refuse to do it; and more.
Look, this bill is far from perfect. It's a compromise. But it is—that's often how progress is made: by compromises. And the fact is that my message to Congress is this: This is the strongest bill you can pass to lower inflation, cut the deficit, reduce health care costs, tackle the climate crisis, and promote energy security, all the time while reducing the burdens facing working class and middle class families.
So pass it. Pass it for the American people. Pass it for America. I'll have more to say on this later.
Now I want to thank Leader Schumer and Manchin—Joe Manchin, Senator Manchin—for the extraordinary effort that it took to reach this result. Thank you.
And let me speak to one other issue.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President——
The President. Let me speak to one other issue: the GDP and whether or not they're—we are in recession. Both Chairman Powell and many of the significant banking personnel and economists say we're not in a recession. But let me just give you what the facts are in terms of the state of the economy.
Number one, we have a record job market of—record unemployment of 3.6 percent today. We've created 9 million new jobs so far, just since I've become President. Businesses are investing in America at record rates—at record rates. Foreign businesses like SK and others are investing in America hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars, sum total.
A hundred billion dollars in semiconductor investments already announced by Intel, Samsung, and Texas Instruments. More than $100 billion in electric vehicle battery investments by Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Tesla, and more.
And just last week, it had—SK corporation of the Republic of Korea announced $22 billion in new investment in semiconductor, batteries, chargers, and medical devices, creating another 16,000 jobs here in America. And this is powering the strongest rebound in American manufacturing in over three decades, creating 613,000—613,000—manufacturing jobs.
Passing the CHIPS bill is going to put another $72 billion for incentives and tax credits to expand semiconductor production. And the Inflation Reduction Act will add another $370 billion in clean energy tax credits in reconciliation, including incentives to accelerate domestic production of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical materials processing.
That doesn't sound like a recession to me. Thank you very much.

"July 27, 2022","Remarks on COVID-19 Prevention, Testing, and Treatment Efforts ","The President. As I was walking out, I thought I heard a rumbling in my staff saying, ""Oh, he's back."" [Laughter] Thanks for sticking around.
Hello, everyone. I've just tested negative for COVID-19 after isolating for 5 days. [Applause] Thankfully, I'll now be able to return to work in person. But I want to thank you all for your well wishes, your prayers over this past week, and the calls I've gotten.
I also want to thank the medical team here at the White House for the incredible care they gave me. Fortunately, God thankfully, thank—God willing, there were—my symptoms were mild, my recovery was quick, and I'm feeling great. The entire time I was in isolation, I was able to work to carry out the duties of the office and without any interruption. It's a real statement on where we are in the fight against COVID-19.
Right now we are facing a new variant, the BA.5 variant, a very transmissible version of Omicron variant we saw here this past winter. In fact, this new variant that infected me is getting a lot of people infected all around the world, not just here in the United States. We should take precautions to try to slow the spread of this virus.
My administration has made billions of dollars in funding available to improve ventilation in our schools and our public buildings. We've made tests widely available so you can take one before attending a large, indoor gatherings or visiting with high-risk individuals. We've made high-quality masks available for free, so you should consider wearing a mask when you're in a crowded, indoor public place.
These precautions add an extra layer of protection for you and for those around you. But the reality is that BA.5 means many of us are still going to get COVID even if we take the precautions. That doesn't mean we are—we were doing anything wrong.
Unfortunately, this COVID is still with us, as it has been for 2½ years. But our fight against COVID is making a huge difference. What's different now is our ability to protect ourselves from serious illness due to COVID. In fact, that's radically different today than it was just a year ago. COVID isn't gone, but even with cases climbing in this country, COVID deaths are down nearly 90 percent. And when I took office—that's 90-percent difference between today and when I took office.
That's what's new—that's what's new—in COVID response, different from where we were just a year ago. Even if COVID—if you get COVID, you can avoid winding up in a—with a severe case. You can now prevent most COVID deaths. And that's because three free tools my administration has invested in and distributed this past year: booster shots; at-home tests; easy-to-use, effective treatments.
We've got through COVID with no fear—I got through it with no fear. A very mild discomfort because of these essentials, lifesaving tools. And guess what? I want to remind everybody: They are free. They are convenient. And they are safe, and they work.
First, booster shots. They weren't available a year ago; they are now—everywhere. Every person age 5 and over should get a booster shot. If you're over 50 years old, you should get two booster shots. I did. And if you have your boosters—one, if you are under 50; two, if you are over 50—your odds of getting severely ill from COVID are very, very low.
Even older Americans are very unlikely to get severe COVID if they have two booster shots. Most COVID deaths are among those who are not up to date on their shots, their COVID vaccinations. So if you're over 50 and you haven't gotten a booster shot this year, go get one right away. Go to COVID.gov, type in your ZIP Code, and find a place where you can get a booster shot for free, usually at a site that's less than 5 miles from your home.
Second, at-home tests. A year ago, at-home tests were rare and expensive. Now everyone in America can get them for free, shipped to their door. Shipped to their door. There's no excuse. Again, go to COVID.gov and order at-home tests for free. Testing to find out if your symptoms mean you have COVID is critical in getting treatment quickly.
Third, treatments. If you test positive, you have a new powerful—we have a new powerful treatment called Paxlovid. It wasn't available a year ago. It's now—it's a pill. And now you can take these pills at home. You can get them for free at tens of thousands of local drug stores around the country.
The Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, even put in a special rule so many pharmacists can prescribe these—this particular drug so you don't even have to go to the doctor to get a prescription.
Millions of Americans have used Paxlovoid—Paxlovid, excuse me—Paxlovid. [Laughter] I tell you what: I think it's—I used it. [Laughter] No—Paxlovid, including me. This lifesaving drug reduces risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 by about 90 percent.
Again, it's free, safe, and easy to take. And we've moved quickly to make it widely available, including the thousands of convenient test-to-treat sites where you can get tested, and if you need it, Paxlovid is at the—ready right then and there when you make your visit. Again, go to COVID.gov to find where test-and-treat sites are that are near you.
Here's the bottom line: When my predecessor got COVID, he had to get helicoptered to Walter Reed Medical Center. He was severely ill. Thankfully, he recovered. When I got COVID, I worked from upstairs of the White House—in the offices upstairs—and for the—that 5-day period.
The difference is vaccinations, of course, but also three new tools free to all and widely available. You don't need to be a President to get these tools to—used for your defense. In fact, the same booster shots, the same at-home test, the same treatment that I got is available to you.
My administration has made sure that all Americans across the country, from all walks of life, have free access to those tools. COVID was killing thousands of Americans a day when I got here. That isn't the case anymore. You can live without fear by doing what I did: get boosted, get tested, and get treatment.
At the same time, my administration remains vigilant. Right now we have the tools to keep you from getting severely ill or dying from COVID, but we're not stopping there.
Earlier this week, we had a conference at the White House for—about the next generation of vaccines, with a goal of keeping people from getting sick in the first place, getting COVID at all—even getting it.
Let me close with this: Over the past 18 months, my administration has left no stone unturned in our fight against this pandemic. None. We brought down deaths by nearly 90 percent since I took office because of the help of all the people in this Rose Garden.
Businesses and schools responded. Grandparents are hugging their kids and grandkids again. Weddings, birthdays, celebrations are happening in person again. So let's keep emerging from one of the darkest moments in our history with hope and light for what can come.
Get vaccinated if you haven't gotten it already. And now get boosted. Order your free test. And if you get sick and test positive, seek treatment. Take advantage of these lifesaving tools. We have more of these tools than we ever had before.
And, to my friends in Congress, let's keep investing in these tools—vaccinations, treatments, tests, and more—so we can help making them available to American—the American people on a permanent basis. Let's get moving. When I say a ""permanent basis"": as long as they are needed. Let's keep moving forward safely.
God bless you all. And now I get to go back to the Oval Office. [Applause] Thank you all very much.

"July 26, 2022","Remarks in a Virtual Meeting With SK Group Chairman Tae-won ""Anthony"" Chey on Investments in United States Manufacturing ","National Economic Council Director Brian C. Deese. Hi, Mr. President.
The President. How are you?
Hey, Tony. How are you, pal?
Mr. Chey. Hello. Yes, really good to see you.
Director Deese. So, Mr. President——
The President. I should be sitting immediately to your right. I'm only a couple hundred yards away. I apologize I'm not there. [Laughter]
Director Deese. Yes, sir, Mr. President, thank you for joining us.
And as you know, we have the—we have the delegation from SK here. We're—thrilled to have you here at the White House and to discuss this very significant announcement of investment that SK is making today.
With your permission, Mr. President, I will just turn the floor to Chairman Chey to brief you and update you directly on the announcement that they're making today. And then we can get into the conversation.
The President. It's a big announcement. Take as long as you need, Tony. [Laughter]
Mr. Chey. Thank you. Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Biden—yes, President Biden. I know I speak for the people of the South Korea in wishing you the speedy recovery. [Laughter]
And I would like to express that my sincere gratitude for this opportunity to discuss our current and future cooperation in manufacturing critical technologies in U.S.
Thank you also, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese, for your support of our investment in United States.
We are also grateful for the strong partnerships we have formed across your—the administration, in Congress, and in many State Government—yes—that have helped make our investment happen.
So tomorrow we will commemorate 69 years since the end of the Korean war. So the American and Korean relationship is deep and longstanding. Now, our countries fought side by side during the terrible conflict, but—and now we have worked side by side to build the technologies and infrastructures that will power the 21st-century economy around the world.
So SK's commitment to grow and invest in Korea is enduring. But today, though, we are here to talk about the investment in U.S. So our cooperation will make the supply chain in both our countries more resilient in critical technologies. And the SK Group commitment to the United States runs deep, and we have backed that commitment with $22 billion of investment in U.S. in recent years.
Today we are announcing another $22 billion in new investment in the U.S., so including the major investment in semiconductors, the EV batteries, and biotechnology. All this means that SK will invest in nearly $30 billion going forward, expanding on our recent announcement of $7 billion investment in EV batteries.
And so SK will invest the half of our total investment amount in the U.S. in semiconductor ecosystem. Well, this money will fund R&D programs in partnership with leading American universities and distribution—advanced packaging firm in the U.S. Well, these initiatives will contribute to developing the next generation of memory chips, which will benefit the entire U.S. high-tech industry.
So, President Biden, we share your commitment to green energy. In addition to our new EV battery factories in Georgia, we will be—we will investing more—$7 billion more out of the total, our JV investment amount—up to $14 billion—to build two new gigafactory in Tennessee and Kentucky as a part of our joint venture with the Ford Motor Company.
So we will invest an additional $5 billion in other green energy businesses, including the ultrafast EV charging system, the green hydrogen, and battery materials, recycling, and also small modular reactors.
Also, our investment will expand our facility in the U.S. in bioscience and biopharmaceutical sectors. We believe our initiatives will contribute to strengthen the U.S. supply chain resilience and to address the climate change.
So we are sincerely grateful to your administration's continued support in our shared prosperity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you, Tony, and to your delegation. This is—as someone once said in a similar circumstance, this the big deal. [Laughter] This is really, really consequential. And you know, I'm sorry, as I said, I'm not with you in person, but I wanted to make sure that—to personally thank you for this historic announcement.
You know, this pathbreaking announcement represents clear evidence that the United States, Korea, and its allies are back and winning the technology competition of the 21st century. For folks at home, the SK Group is the second largest conglomerate in South Korea. And since I've been President, it has made significant investments in United States.
SK has already committed $30 billion in investment here, and today they're announcing another $22 billion in addition. That will grow their U.S. workforce from 4,000 to 20,000 workers by 2025, investing in a range of advanced technologies, some of which Tony already mentioned, from semiconductors to large-capacity batteries, to electric vehicle chargers, and to pharmaceuticals.
And partnering with an iconic American company, like Ford and Intel, this is just incredible. Further proof that America is open for business. Proof that we're meeting the emergency and the climate crisis with urgency and opportunity and innovation to save the planet and create good-paying jobs to benefit both our countries.
We're investing more than $1 trillion in the United States to modernize our infrastructure, including 500,000 electric charging stations across America. Since I came to office, we've seen more than $200 billion in private-sector energy investments in electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and semiconductors. Construction of overall manufacturing facilities in America has increased by 116 percent. And this is only going to add to that, Tony. Thank you.
And the construction in America means jobs in—for Americans. Since I've been in office, the economy has created 613,000 overall manufacturing jobs—just manufacturing jobs.
Today's announcement is also proof that America is back to working with our allies. By uniting our skills and innovation, we will be able to manufacture the technologies that create the critical changes that are needed both for our—for both our countries.
During my visit to South Korea in May, when I got to sit at the table across from Tony—and it was a crowded room—I toured Samsung's campus with President Yoon, and I saw how the factory there is manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips and is committing $17 billion to build a similar factory here in America.
In Seoul, I met with the chairman of Hyundai, and we announced—as we announced $10 billion in new investments in America—American manufacturing, including a $5.5 billion investment for an advanced automotive factory near Savannah, Georgia, where SK is also going to be investing and creating more than 8,000 jobs.
In the past, these kinds of technology investments went to China. Today, under my administration, these technology investments are coming to the United States. We're talking about some of the most significant investments we've ever seen in our country.
America is the key destination for advanced technologies, and it's the kind of—it's that kind of proactive engagement that reminds me one of the benefits of investing in the United States, and that is the opportunity to partner with some of the most highly skilled, dedicated, and engaged workers in the world: American union members.
Now, look, just yesterday I met with members of my economic and national security teams and CEOs and labor leaders to highlight the urgency of getting the bipartisan CHIPS Act to my desk. And today the Senate took a very important bipartisan step to get us closer. They, in fact, met the cloture requirement, and getting that bill to my desk is much closer now. Because this really matters.
Let me—let me close with this: You know, Tony, you and your team, I want to thank you for being here at the White House. And again, I feel so badly—I'm so close to you, but because I'm in the last day of having been diagnosed with COVID—and I'm feeling great; I hope it comes across that way as well. I hope I look as great as I feel here. But you know—and you're—[laughter]—well, you know what I mean. [Laughter] That sounded awful, didn't it? [Laughter] I never look that good. I hope I look as good as I usually do, which is not that good. [Laughter]
And look, but—[laughter]—but I want to thank you again for being at the White House and for your investment in American workers, our greatest resource. And, Tony, as you begin the rest of the meeting today, what more do you think we can do to keep this momentum going?
Mr. Chey. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And it is really my pleasure being here. And even though you're not in person with me, but close enough. [Laughter]
The President. I can walk out on the balcony and holler to you. [Laughter]
Mr. Chey. But you certainly don't have to sell us on investing in the U.S. because we already committed about $30 billion and $22 billion in a pipeline.
The President. Yes.
Mr. Chey. Well, we created tens of thousands of highly paid and highly skilled jobs. But we believe—our view is, the United States is our most important business partners. But one thing we can work together is building a skillful workforce. That would be the crucial for ensuring that America has a type of worker necessary to lead the next generation—the manufacturing economy.
So we will work closely with the State and community colleges to help ensure that workers know what they need to know to lead jobs in our facility. The Federal, State, and the local coordination, and the deep investment in job training, would help other companies to find the skillset they need and invest more in—here in U.S. as well. So we look forward to working with you, Mr. President, and—on advancing the workforce, the training in the coming years.
That's one thing. But here is another things that I want to mention to you as well: I'd like to actually emphasizing some partnerships among the company and the nonprofit organization in U.S. and Korea. So we believe the collaboration among the organization of the two countries will motivate them to invest more across the border.
So, for example—I will give you the—some examples that SK worked closely with Novavax as a—the pharma—U.S. pharmaceutical company to develop the—produce the COVID-19 vaccine.
The President. Yes.
Mr. Chey. So, as a result of the coinvesting in R&D and the production capacity.
One other example is, as a recent matter, is SK is also partnering with the Gates Foundation and the University of Washington to develop the new COVID vaccine. This is a new one.
The President. Yes.
Mr. Chey. So this is a kind of proven collaboration model that can bolster the investing in the U.S.
So, Mr. President, and we look forward to working with you—this fostering such a kind of partnership with you. So thank you.
The President. Well, it is a partnership. And we've been partners a long time. And as we've—I think about it, I can remember the pictures of my uncle—anyway, from people being sent from Korea back home when I was a kid, about—and so we've been partners a long time.
And look, one of the things that I promise you we're going to do is, we're going to continue to invest in the education side of this to have—so you have the best trained, the best equipped workers in the world. I really mean it. And particularly with regard to our community colleges, which have great assets to bring to the—to bring to bear.
And I think that—I just see this as the beginning of so many more things we can do. And I can see that—that the Secretary is smiling, and she thinks it's the beginning too. And I'm going to leave it to you guys to talk about.
But anyway, thank you, all three of you. And again, I apologize for not being with you. Next time you come, I'm going to force you to have lunch with me in the Oval Office so you can see what we—what I don't do. You know? I mean, the Oval Office is lovely, but we—I've got—I'm all the way over here; I can't even be near you.
So, at any rate, thanks again for everything. I look forward—I really mean this: The way you treated our delegation when we've gone to Korea, to the Republic; the way you've—we've hung together on foreign policy as a matter of domestic and economic policy—I know that's not your responsibility. But your—but your country has stepped up as an enormous, enormous asset and ally.
So thank you, thank you, thank you.
Mr. Chey. Thank you very much, Mr. President.

"July 25, 2022","Remarks in a Virtual Meeting With Business and Labor Leaders on Legislation To Promote United States Semiconductor Production, Technological Innovation, and Advanced Manufacturing and an Exchange With Reporters ","National Economic Council Director Brian C. Deese. Hi, Mr. President
The President. How are you?
Director Deese. Good, good. I think we've got everybody here, so over to you to kick us off here.
The President. Okay, here I go.
Thank you all for joining me today for this important and timely discussion. We're here today to talk about the importance of passing the CHIPS for America Act to strengthen our national and economic security. Later today the Senate is going to hold a key vote to advance this critical legislation, God willing, and I'm glad we have an opportunity to hear from the industry and labor leaders about this important topic.
I'm going to turn this over to Brian now to get us started. Brian?
Director Deese. Great, thank you, Mr. President. And we are joined here by members of your economic and national security team, as well as business and labor leaders from across the country. We thought, sir, that we would try to divide this into two categories, the first being the national security implications and the second being the economic security and economic opportunity embedded in this legislation.
And—but we wanted to really try to zero in on both the urgency of acting and of Congress, as you say, acting without delay, hopefully, today and in the coming days, but also the opportunity: the opportunity for the country and for our national security as well.
So, sir, with your permission, we will start on the national security side and, kicking this off, go to Jim Taiclet, the CEO of Lockheed Martin. You've had the opportunity to visit their facility down in Alabama earlier this year.
And, Jim, I was hoping if you could just—for the President and all of us, just give us your sense of the broader national security concern here and also the ways in which semiconductors feed into the strength of our national security industrial base across the country.
Lockheed Martin Corporation Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer James D. Taiclet. Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, Mr. President.
The President. Good afternoon, Jim.
Mr. Taiclet. We believe a robust, secure supply of microprocessors is essential both to national security and to the health of the defense industrial base in the aerospace industry as a whole.
[At this point, Mr. Taiclet continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So it's critical to increase U.S. production and test capacity. There's a couple other reasons it's very important too. One is trust. We've got to have confidence in the security of the hardware itself, that it hasn't been tampered with or degraded when we receive it, to put it into our aircraft, in missiles, satellite, et cetera. Right?
The President. Brian had mentioned that, yes.
Mr. Taiclet. Also, we want to have ""Made in the U.S.A."" access to the latest cutting-edge technologies to put into the systems that our sailors, marines, airmen, and soldiers are going to be using in our defense.
[Mr. Taiclet continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And so, given the long leadtimes for producing a fab and building the factories, it is important and urgent to begin to rebuild U.S. semiconductor chip manufacturing in the U.S.
The President. Jim, I'm glad you mentioned security: to be secure that any part we're putting in a weapons system or a helicopter, or anything we have, that we are assured that no one has been able to tamper with that; that it's made in America and built in America, stockpiled in America. And I think it's really important.
And by the way, I was really impressed with your workers down in Alabama when they went through the plant. I was there for several hours, as you know. And I think they really, really take their work seriously.
And so how does passing this legislation now—how does this make a difference and how—and how does it ensure our systems are going to stay at the leading edge? It's one thing to say there's uninterrupted access—we make it here and build it here in America. But tell me—talk to me a little bit more about how this ensures the systems stay on the leading edge.
Mr. Taiclet. Well, we're moving forward really rapidly, Mr. President, both in sort of physical-world technologies like hypersonics, really advanced space sensors, stealth aircraft like the F-35, et cetera. But we're also inserting what we call 21st-century digital technologies into the system as well. And those are things like 5G, AI, distributed cloud computing. We need the latest in, you know, sub-10 nanometer chips, and we need them to be trustworthy to be able to introduce those kinds of capabilities, you know, again, in service of our, you know, sailors, airmen, guardians, marines, and aviators.
So we've got a lot of emphasis and a lot of importance on those latest technology chips because they are the building blocks of those defense systems of the future.
The President. Am I correct to assume that the more sophisticated systems are going to be coming along, and the more that do—just inevitable—the more the need for reliance on the availability of these high-end computer chips are available to us, made in America, here in America—I mean, is there a correlation there?
Mr. Taiclet. There's a total correlation, Mr. President. You can't conduct, you know, 5G-distributed cloud-computing operations with, you know, legacy technology chips. And we're going to have to stay on the cutting edge of those building blocks, as I mentioned earlier, to be able to deliver that for the country.
So it's really important that we don't cede our leadership in semiconductor technology and, ultimately, manufacturing and test outside the U.S. Because, again, just like the Russians did with natural gas recently in Europe, if China can constrain its own production and distribution of chips to us or they pressure or otherwise inhibit Taiwan from doing so, you have a global market that's going to be upset. It will go beyond the defense industry. But from a national, you know, security perspective, you know, I think this is a really high priority.
The President. Jim, thank you very much. And again, you should be proud of the folks you have down in your factory. I was really impressed with them. They seemed to really—not just they're doing their job, but they seem to be on a mission. I mean, I'm serious. It was great to see. It was great to see.
Anyway, thank you.
Mr. Taiclet. It meant so much for all of them to see you, Mr. President, and show your support. So thanks.
The President. Thank you.
Director Deese. So, Mr. President, I wanted to——
The President. Brian, it's all yours.
Director Deese. Yes. I wanted to ask Deputy Secretary Hicks and Jake both to come in here to put the risks and the threats that Jim is framing up in the broader perspective here. And maybe, Deputy Secretary Hicks, if you could start in sort of talking about the core security risks that you think are in play here when we're talking about semiconductors.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen H. Hicks. Absolutely, Brian. So Jim Taiclet did a great job, I think, laying out the dependency that we have on the defense side, that our military has on advanced microelectronics—whether it's the Javelins we saw down in Alabama or the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that Lockheed Martin puts out to our nuclear weapons forces; and of course, as we look ahead to the future on emerging technologies, just as Jim said—quantum, AI, hypersonics, 5G, 6G, next G—all of that is heavily dependent on ensuring our access to microelectronics.
[Deputy Secretary Hicks continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
By creating opportunities to onshore microelectronics fabrication, assembly, and testing, the CHIPS-Plus Act helps solve these two important, critical, pressing microelectronics challenges facing our military: both this issue of making sure we have assured access and also making sure that we can have state-of-the-art technology to our warfighters.
Director Deese. Jake.
National Security Adviser Jacob J. Sullivan. Thanks, Brian. And thanks to both Jim and Kath, who I think have really summed up the case very powerfully. So I'll be brief in expanding on why the CHIPS Act is so essential for both our national security and our strategic competitiveness.
[National Security Adviser Sullivan continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So, when it comes down to it, there's bipartisan consensus, there's support from business, there's support from labor, there's support from the national security community across the board, and there is support from the American people to pass this legislation now and meet this moment and resolve these vulnerabilities.
Thanks, Brian.
The President. Jake, I'd like to ask you a question, if I can. You've heard me say it a bunch of times the last 15 months or so, and that is: It used to be, 30 years ago or longer, we invested more than 2 percent of our GDP in research—pure research and development. It got down by, I think, 0.7 percent of one—seven-tenths of 1 percent. And China and others have moved precipitously to invest more, particularly China, in research and development—pure research and development.
And you say the second piece of this bill, not the purely defense piece. Elaborate a little more on what that will encourage or what we hope it will encourage; what kind of research and the types of development we're talking about—or are we—in that regard.
National Security Adviser Sullivan. No, absolutely. As I was saying, the—our ability to maintain our innovation edge, to maintain our technology leadership rests on having the necessary inputs like chips, but it also rests on, as you just said, those foundational investments in the industries of the future, investments that are made in basic research on everything from artificial intelligence to quantum computing, to biotechnology, to the future of the internet and the future of telecommunications.
[National Security Adviser Sullivan continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And in doing so, it will also help us shape the rules of the road on technology, on these important technologies, in a way that reflects our interests and our values and doesn't let—leave them to be written by a competitor or a challenger of ours who doesn't share the same values we share.
The President. I think that's a really important point. I think the point is that we have—as we've led the world in the past in research and development, generating new technologies—we've been inclined to share it with the rest of the world, not sort of just use it as a economic weapon. We've expanded, and our partners—the democracies of the world—have benefited. And it seems to me this is—this makes up a part of that.
Madam Secretary, can I ask you a question as well? The—you responded to Jim's comments and gave your views on the core security risks at play. What—from your perspective, what is maybe—are you able to prioritize what risks are greater or less—security risk? That's a tough question, because who knows for certain. But—[laughter]—I didn't mean to put you on the spot, but can you sort of weigh them for me a little bit?
Deputy Secretary Hicks. Sure. I think that in today's weapons systems, what we worry about most is the compromise of the supply chain of the chips that are in our existing weapons systems, or as we upgrade, as we always have to do, and put new chips in, those are, as I said, largely dependent on the commercial market for whatever those chips may be.
[Deputy Secretary Hicks continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And for that, we need that next-generation, most advanced, most capable microelectronics supply chain to be secure.
The President. That's important. All right. Well, thank you very much.
Brian——
Director Deese. Yes.
The President. ——back to you.
Director Deese. Thank you, Mr. President. So we're going to pivot here from the national security case, which I think you've heard is both compelling and urgent to the economic security element of this.
And obviously, as we make these investments, our goal is to generate durable economic opportunity here in the United States, and the opportunity there is quite significant. We're going to bring in Geoff and Tom and Mark and Chris into this conversation. But to just frame this up at the beginning, I want to ask Secretary Raimondo to just give us the, sort of, broader perspective here on the economics.
And the—in addition to being tireless on this effort, Secretary Raimondo and the Commerce Department, if passed, will be given principal responsibility for implementing this legislation. So, Madam Secretary, if you could just sort of tee up what you see as the economic context, and then I want to bring in Geoff and Tom and Mark and Chris to this conversation.
Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo. Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good to see you. And thank you for convening all of us on this incredibly important topic.
So, look, I think the most important thing Congress can do right now to support America's economy and America's workers and our global competitiveness is to get this CHIPS Act over the finish line and onto your desk this week. It's vital. You know, the CHIPS Act proposes a $52 billion investment in domestic semiconductor production, which will enable us to revitalize our domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
[Secretary Raimondo continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And we need Congress to act so we send a clear signal to the world that we're serious about rebuilding our domestic manufacturing industry. It's good for our economy, it's good for our competitiveness, and it's good for American workers.
Director Deese. Thanks. Thanks, Gina. I want to bring, Geoff—you and Tom into this conversation. And maybe I'll start with you, Geoff, that—the Secretary just mentioned it, but some people are actually surprised to understand the health care nexus here. But can you just elaborate a bit on how you see the systemic impact in the health care industry, both on the risk side, but also the opportunity side, when you—when you're thinking about semiconductors and the security of supply of those chips?
Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Geoffrey Martha. Sure. Well, first of all, thank you, Mr. President, for including me in this really important conversation. It's a real honor to represent the medical technology industry here.
You know, Brian, as you were saying, you know, one of the most critical aspects of our ability at Medtronic and for the medical technology at large to get lifesaving and innovative medical technology to patients is semiconductors. They are essential components in thousands of medical devices—Secretary Raimondo was referring to—that Americans rely on every day.
Things like instruments that enable surgery or devices that manage chronic conditions, like an insulin pump for a diabetes patient, or a pacemaker for a patient with an irregular heartbeat, or even treating COVID. Right? We manufacture pulse oximeters that measure the oxygenation of the blood, as well as ventilators for those patients that are really sick with COVID.
[Mr. Martha continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And we—I could give you thousands of examples like that, where the use of chips inside devices, on the edge, in the cloud, and the advancements in computing power are really being harnessed to change patient care. And in such a profound way, you're improving outcomes, you're improving access, and you're bringing down cost all at the same time.
So that's the exciting part that we want to accelerate, but it's really hard right now, given the semiconductor supply that we're facing.
Director Deese. Thanks. Thanks, Geoff.
Tom, I wonder if you could offer your perspective too. We've heard a lot about the concerns in the transportation sector and engines, but also—both in the today constraints—but also the vision forward to the electrification of the transportation sector as well. We welcome your thoughts here.
Cummins Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Linebarger. Thank you, Brian.
And, Mr. President, it's great to see you so well. Thank you for the opportunity to join this group of thought leaders from Government and industry and labor on the importance particularly of innovation funding for the semiconductor industry.
I think you know Cummins is an over 100-year-old company. We are headquartered in Columbus, Indiana. We have over 25,000 employees in the U.S. And we work together to innovate on power solutions from the industrial sector. It's remarkable how much Geoff and I have in common, with our perspective on semiconductors, from completely different sectors.
[Mr. Linebarger continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
The way that I think about that is that these—the investments made in the CHIP Act are going to move us from wringing our hands about where we sit in competition with others, to actually moving onto the field and helping U.S. manufacturers compete.
And I think we all know that when U.S. manufacturers compete with the workforce that we have and the capabilities we have, we can win.
Director Deese. Thank you, Tom.
I—Mr. President, with your permission, I would just ask Chris to come in here too.
On that last point, Tom, that you made, I think is very salient that this is a bill that is also about opportunity for Americans, workers, and for the opportunity to build good jobs, good jobs in construction and installation and operations of both the facilities to produce chips themselves and the larger and broader ecosystem.
So, Chris, could you just give us your perspective from the ground of how you're thinking about this bill and where you see the opportunity for American workers?
The President. I can't hear him.
Director Deese. Chris, if you can hear us, I think you're muted.
Communications Workers of America President Christopher M. Shelton. Sorry. Thanks for inviting me here, Mr. President. We're really grateful to be here, because as far as we know, CWA is the only union representing manufacturing workers at a final assembly semiconductor factory in the United States, and we have been strong supporters of the CHIPS Act.
[Mr. Shelton continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So this bill is a key part of rebuilding our manufacturing sector as a whole. There's no question that we need a comprehensive approach to compete and to take on China's unfair trade practices. This bill is a great first step in putting that approach together. I hope that Congress sends this bill to your desk, Mr. President, as soon as possible, and continues working to strengthen our competitiveness and create good jobs for American workers.
Thank you.
The President. Thank you, Chris.
Director Deese. Mr. President, we're——
The President. Brian——
Director Deese. We've lost Mark for the time being, so let me turn it back to you, Mr. President, for any questions you have or closing comments here.
The President. Well, I do have a couple of questions for Tom. I'd like to go back to him for a second. You know, Tom, since I took office, there have been a massive investment in electronic vehicles and the EV batteries.
I know Cummins is on the cutting edge of fuel cell and battery electronic technology. These technologies are more—they use more semiconductors. And how's this legislation going to make a difference for you in terms of accelerating your innovation?
And I might add that in the act we passed for infrastructure, we have an awful lot of money for putting in electronic charging stations all throughout America, along our highways and the like and—but that doesn't even count the battery technologies that we need to develop other things.
So talk to me a little bit about the technologies and the use of semiconductors, and why that's likely to increase, and how this is going to affect innovation. Because I know it's a broad question and maybe not a fair——
Mr. Linebarger. It's a great President—it's a great question, Mr. President, and thank you for asking it.
It—the use of semiconductors in cars and trucks and other industrial equipment goes by an exponential scale effect. Every single new range of models, you see an exponential increase in semiconductors. I think that's part of the reason why the industry is so far behind now.
The President. Yes.
Mr. Linebarger. As the demand increased for vehicles, they just didn't do the math right about how many more of these legacy chips we were going to need.
[Mr. Linebarger continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And the—of course, the infrastructure bill was a big help there. I think there's also hydrogen that's going to be needed in the semiconductor industry.
The President. Absolutely.
Mr. Linebarger. And we're—we and other companies in the U.S. offer electrolyzers that can provide that hydrogen using green energy, and then we have green hydrogen so we decarbonize the industry significantly as well.
So there are—there's a lot of upsides for us investing here in the U.S. in terms of building out that clean energy portfolio that allows us to lead for decades to come.
The President. Well, I couldn't agree with you more. I—it seems to me that—you know, like, I joke—and I don't joke, because I'm serious when I say it. When I think of climate change, I think jobs. And I think there's so many opportunities that we have. And people, understandably, don't even realize that if we could just get our act together in the Congress, we'd be able to do a heck of a lot more and create literally thousands and thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs.
Let me shift over. I was going to ask Mark as well, but, Chris, thank you for all the support you've been giving to this effort. You know, it was a top priority for me to ensure that incentives for semiconductors have a Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirement. And these semiconductor projects—there are billions of dollars and thousands of construction jobs in each of these sites.
And how are those Davis-Bacon requirements going to make sure that jobs—that those jobs are good jobs? Is there a correlation?
Mr. Shelton. Yes, the Davis-Bacon requirements will make sure that people—you know, that there isn't a race to the bottom; that there'll be an even playing field for the people working in this industry and the people working on building the factories that will build these semiconductors. And you know, Davis-Bacon requirements will make sure that that happens and that, you know, no one will be left behind.
And it will give us really, really good union jobs, mostly, to make sure that the factories are built by union labor and that the manufacturing is done by professional union people who really care about what they're doing and will stay on the job because they're making good wages and have a good job.
The President. [Inaudible]—union labor is that, you know, you are—all the folks working for you essentially have a college degree in the technology that they're working. I mean, you just don't join your union and all of a sudden everything falls in place. You've got to go to school, in effect; you've got to be trained; you've got to be in a position to be able to do what you do better than anybody in the world does it. And so that was the reason why I'm pushing Davis-Bacon.
And you know, some of the facilities that—one that, God willing, will be built very shortly—it was announced a while ago, pending what happens in this legislation now—is one outside of Columbus, Ohio. And it's going to create a whole lot of jobs, about—it's going to create a lot of jobs, but it's also going to create a whole lot of jobs in building the facilities. And it just—it matters a lot, it seems to me.
And I've—and I say to all of you: I think we're a heck of a lot stronger as an economy and more sustainable when we build from the bottom up and the middle out, because when that happens, everyone does well—business does very, very well; the wealthy do very, very well.
And I think we've got a shot as we move down the line here. And this CHIPS bill is an important piece of it to be able to stay in the game and be the most competitive nation in the world. That's what we have to reestablish. We still are in a lot of places, but we've got to do it here.
And—but I don't know. Chris, you were talking about the benefits that workers in the communications and media industry, as well as the importance of manufacturing jobs and the country's supply chain resilience—do you guys talk about that? Do you worry about whether or not that's going to happen? I mean, is that something, you know, you're sitting around, that your guys actually discuss, in practical terms?
Mr. Shelton. We talk about it every day, Mr. President, because we see what's happening. We see that lots of industries that—as some of the CEOs said, lots of them can't build or make whatever it is they make because they can't get semiconductors, for instance.
And that, you know, when it's another country making these things instead of good American workers, they can always stop, and they do stop, and we see this happening every day. And we—you know, we worry about what's going to happen to this country if nothing is ever made here again. If we don't make it here, we can't be sure that, A, it works; and that, B, we're going to be able to use it.
The President. Well, we've actually increased manufacturing, thank God, even though we've missed opportunities. But we've increased manufacturing here at home.
And look, I want to thank everyone for joining today's meeting. I know I've kept you a long time here. But the CHIPS Act, in my view, is going to advance the Nation's competitiveness and our technological edge.
You know, we've been working closely with the Senate and the House to finalize a strong bipartisan bill. Congress must pass this bill as soon as possible so we can get it to my desk so we can sign it and get moving. I know we just talked about it, but for the folks at home, let me explain why this is so urgent.
First, there's an economic imperative. As we just heard, this bill is going to supercharge our efforts to make semiconductors—those tiny chips the size of a fingerprint, which is—you know, some are larger, but the size of a fingerprint—that power our everyday lives in America. You know, they're the building blocks for the modern economy, powering everything from smartphones, to dishwashers, to automobiles. I could go on.
America invented semiconductors, but over the years, we let the manufacturing of those semiconductors get sent overseas. And we saw that, during the pandemic, when our factories overseas that make these chips shut down because of in the case of—COVID was a big reason for it—the global economy basically comes to a halt, driving up the costs for families all around the world, but particularly here at home.
One-third of the core inflation last year in 2021—one-third of it—was due to the high price of automobiles. You know why? It was driven—that's driven by the inability to manufacture more automobiles. Why? The shortage of semiconductors. One-third.
And even as we had that historic job growth and economic growth last year, we sacrificed $240 billion in additional economic activity because of the chips shortage. So, for the sake of the economy and jobs, we have to make these semiconductors here at home—at home.
Second, there is a national—as you heard, there's a national security imperative, as Deputy Defense Secretary Hicks and Jake Sullivan pointed out. Semiconductors also power our weapons systems.
And, Jim, earlier this year, I went down to Lockheed's factory, as I said, in Alabama, where they're making the Javelin missile that we're supplying to Ukraine to defend themselves against Putin's unprovoked war.
It's a crystal clear to me that we need these semiconductors—crystal clear, guys; all you have to do is be there and talk to the workers—not only for these Javelin missiles, but also for the weapons systems of the future that are going to even be more reliant on advanced chips.
Unfortunately, we're not producing enough of them. Taiwan produces 90 percent of the leading-edge chips; we produce zero. China is moving ahead of us in manufacturing these sophisticated chips as well. As we watched the U.S. production of these chips decline from 40 percent of global production to 12 percent, at the same time, we watched China go from 2 percent to 16 percent.
And China's goal, as recently stated, is 25 percent. They need to produce 25 percent to become fully self-sufficient. It's no wonder that China is watching this bill so closely and actively lobbying U.S. businesses against the bill. America invented the semiconductor; it's time to bring it home. Doesn't mean others can't do it. It's time we bring it home for all that we need for our security and our economic growth.
Third, it's just not me signaling the—signaling an urgency here. Listen to the business leaders here today and across the country. They're making decisions right now about where to invest and ramp up production of these semiconductors. Are they going to invest in China, India, Japan, South Korea, the European Union?
They're all making historic investments in the tens of billions of dollars to attract businesses to come to their countries—the countries I just named—to produce these chips. The United States has to lead the world in the production of these chips for our own safety's sake, as well as our economic growth.
Let me be clear: This bill is not about handing out a blank check to companies. Commerce Secretary Raimondo, who will be overseeing the key investments of this bill, explained how she's laser-focused on the guardrails that will protect taxpayers' dollars and the interests of the American workers, small businesses, and the communities in which they reside. And the bill will require that I personally have to sign off on the biggest grants before they can be dispersed. It's not sufficient. I've got to sign off on the big ones.
Secretary Raimondo will have the power that if companies don't meet the commitments and that are—that are required to meet by—in this bill, she can take back the money. This includes the requirement on the construction of these semiconductor facilities to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wage, which will ensure that tens of thousands of new construction jobs are good-paying union jobs and the facility is the best built in the world.
And we're not allowing—you know, we're not going to allow companies to use these funds to buy back stock or issue dividends, but to invest. And finally, this bill is about more than just semiconductors. It authorizes significant investment in American science and technology, which I mentioned earlier.
We have a need to power our economy and national security for the decades to come. We make those decisions now. And the bill has requirements that when we use taxpayer dollars to fund research and development, the companies who get those funds have to deploy that technology that comes from that R&D and the manufacturing of it right here in America. They get the money, they invest, they find a way, they find an answer. They have to invest in America, in a facility here in America.
You know, we'll—we're going to both invent in America and make it in America. And we're going to make sure that we include all of America, tapping into the greatest competitive advantage—our diversity and talented workforce—making sure technologies of the future don't only benefit wealthy shareholders or—[inaudible]—but support technology hubs all across America, including historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and minority-serving institutions, which have the capacity to do so much more given the opportunity.
Look, I know we could go on for a long time—and I'll be back to you, God willing—but I want to thank you again for joining me today and for the work in getting this bill to this point. So we're close. We're close. So let's get it done. So much depends on it.
And thank you all for helping today. I truly appreciate it.
The President's Health Following His Positive COVID-19 Screening 
Q. Mr. President, how are you feeling with COVID?
The President. I'm feeling great, even though I've had 2 full nights of sleep all the way through. Matter of fact, my dog had to wake me up this morning. My wife's not here. She usually takes him out in the morning while I'm upstairs working out. And so I felt this nuzzle of my dog's nose against my chest about 5 minutes to 7.
So—no, but it is—I'm feeling good. My voice is still raspy. I've had—every morning and every afternoon—I mean, excuse me, every evening, I get a full-blown series of tests—everything from temperature, to oxygenation—the oxygen in my—in my blood, to my pulse, to—I mean, just across the board. And so far, everything is good. I mean, everything is on the button.
And so I'm feeling better every day. I still have this—a little bit of a sore throat and a little bit of a cough, but it's changing significantly. It's now up in the upper part of my throat. Actually, it's more around my nose than anywhere else.
And—but they tell me that's par for the course. And I think I'm on my way to a full, total recovery, God willing.
Q. Mr. President, but when do you——
Q. How bored have you been?
The President's Work Schedule
Q. ——when do you think you'll be to work in person, Mr. President?
The President. Well, I hope I'm back to work in person by the end of this week. But I'm—as you know, I've been keeping a full schedule. I mean, I've done four major events today. And I'm—you know, I've—and I didn't start today until 9:30, but—and I'll finish today probably by—what time is it now? I'll finish about 6:30. But—so I'm not keeping the same hours. But I'm—you know, I'm meeting all my requirements that's come before me, and we're making decisions on a whole range of other topics as well.
China-U.S. Relations 
Q. Mr. President, will you speak with President Xi of China this week?
The President. That's my expectation, but I'll let you know when that gets set up. Okay? I promise I'll let you know. It will not be a surprise.
National Economy 
Q. And, Mr. President, we're getting GDP numbers on Thursday. How worried should Americans be that we could be in a recession?
The President. We're not going to be in a recession. And in my view, we are—the employment rate is still one of the lowest we've had in history; it's in the 3.6 area. We still find ourselves with people investing.
My hope is, we go from this rapid growth to a steady growth. And so I'll see—we'll see some coming down. But I don't think we're going to—God willing, I don't think we're going to see a recession.
Thank you all so very, very much.
Q. Feel better.
The President. Thank you.

"
"July 22, 2022",Remarks During a Virtual Briefing on Efforts To Reduce Gasoline Prices and an Exchange With Reporters ,"National Economic Council Director Brian C. Deese. Hey, Mr. President, it's great to see you.
The President. Hey. How you doing?
Director Deese. Good. We've got members of your economic and energy team here. And we're prepared to start the briefing, but we'll start by turning the floor over to you, sir.
The President. Well, thanks. Let me start by apologizing—my voice. I'm feeling much better than I sound.
You know, we're meeting today on gas prices, and we have some really good news: Gas prices are coming down.
In fact, gas prices have fallen every day this summer for 38 days in a row. Now, you know, you can find gas for $3.99 or less in more than 30,000 gas stations in more than 35 States. In some cities, it's down almost a dollar from last month. We've been working really hard to bring the price down.
Four months ago, I gave an order to release 1 million barrels of oil per day—a day—for our Nation—from our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And I led the world to coordinate the largest release of oil reserves in history, including from other countries. In total, more than 240 million barrels to boost global supply.
During that time, I've also been working to increase U.S. production. Today, we're producing 12 million barrels per day, and we're on track to hit a—near-record highs. I've been working to make sure that when the price of oil comes down, the price at the pump comes down as well, and comes down in real time. The good news is that's happening, but it's not happening fast enough. We've made progress, but prices are still too high.
And so here's what I'm going to do—talk about today with all of you. We need to work on this. First, we're going to look at ways to increase oil production from the existing wells and permits that exist today. The industry has more approved permits for production on Federal lands than they can possibly use. That's a fact. Let me say it again: They have more than they can use. So my message to these companies is, use the permits or lose them. Don't say we can't—you don't have access.
Second, I'm telling the industry: ""You're making record profits due to Putin's war in Ukraine. Use those profits to increase production and refining. Don't use those profits to buy back your stocks and dividends.""
Look, thirdly, we'll talk about a global price cap on Russian oil—that I got our partners to agree to last month at the G-7—that will keep supply up and Putin's revenues down. In the days and weeks ahead, I'm going to keep doing what I can to bring down the price of gas at the pump.
But the real answer is to get to a clean energy economy as soon as possible, turn this into something positive. That means cleaner renewable energy, more affordable electric vehicles, and clean energy manufactured here in the United States. That's how we'll protect the climate and create jobs.
I am—well, I'll have more to say about this in our discussions and more in the coming days. But look, I want to stop here and turn it over to you, Brian. And let's get this briefing started.
Thanks.
Director Deese. Great. Thank you, Mr. President.
So we were hoping today to cover three broad areas. The first is market developments, both where we are and we—we're headed. And I'll turn in a moment to Chair Rouse on that front.
The second is developments in the industry and the work that your team has been doing, at your direction, to engage with the industry on refining, on hurricane preparedness, and other issues that Secretary Granholm will update and brief you on.
And the third, as you mentioned, is on international developments, where, on the back of your securing an agreement to explore the price cap coming out of the G-7, Secretary Yellen is back from a multicountry trip across Asia, and she and Amos will give you an update on international developments as well.
So with your permission, sir, we'll now turn it—I'll turn it over to Chair Rouse to talk about market developments.
The President. Thank you. Sure. Cece, I'm anxious to hear you.
Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia E. Rouse. Terrific. So, Mr. President, as you mentioned at the top, Americans are getting some very much badly needed breathing room at the pump. The national average retail gas price today fell to $4.41. That's about 60 cents lower than its mid-June peak.
While this is a national average, it is affected by the traditionally higher prices in Western States. What you see when you look under these data is that more than—in more than 30,000 stations, they're now selling gas for less than $4 a gallon. In fact, the most common gas station price in America today is $3.99 a gallon.
This kind of decline at this time of year is quite unique. This is the 38th day in a row of declining retail gas prices. In fact, the rate of decline is among the fastest in over a decade, a dramatic decline during the peak summer driving season. In other words, it has been a trend, not a daily blip.
The decline translates into concrete savings for American families. The typical two-driver family is saving more than $60 a month. Economy wide, that would mean Americans will spend about $6.5 billion less in a month—over the coming month, and that would be real savings.
Looking forward, we expect gas prices to decline further. However, as you noted, they are still too high. Refiner margins remain roughly double what is typical for this time of year, though they have declined from their record highs. Retailer margins are very elevated and are around 50 cents above what is typical.
What that means is, we expect gas prices at the pump to continue to come down. If the historical relationship between oil and gas prices were to hold, these lower oil prices could translate into an additional 40-cent decline in gas prices if industry passes along cost savings to consumers. This would bring the national average retail price to around $4.
Of course, energy markets remain highly volatile, and that's especially true in the current environment with the additional disruption created by Putin's invasion of Ukraine. So oil prices could rise again. And it is very difficult to reliably predict where these prices will be over the longer term.
Thank you, Brian. Thank you.
Director Deese. Thank you, Cece. We're going to—I'm going to turn it over to Secretary Granholm, but before we do, we're going to ask the press to leave.

Climate Change 
Q. Mr. President, you talked a lot about climate being an emergency today. Why not just declare it an emergency?
The President. Because I'm running into [the]* traps on the totality of the authority I have. I will make that decision soon.
Q. And what would be the ramifications of doing it? Do you think you'd be able to do more?
The President. Well, I think I can do more, unless the Congress acts. In the meantime, I can do more, because not enough is being done now. And so there's still discussions going on about whether or not there will be some action on my climate plan. And that's—I'm told that's in play. And we'll see. We'll see what happens.
Climate Change 
Q. Do you still have hopes for a legislative agreement with Senator Manchin on climate?
The President. I've not spoken to Senator Manchin.
Q. So, no? No hopes for one?
The President. I do not have an agreement with Senator Manchin.
Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi/Taiwan 
Q. Mr. President, do you think it's a good idea for Speaker Pelosi to travel to Taiwan this summer?
The President. Well, I think that—the military thinks it's not a good idea right now, but I don't know what the status of it is.
Abortion 
Q. And what about declaring a public health emergency for abortion, sir? Where does that stand?
The President. Well, that's in consideration as well.
Q. Still? That's still under consideration?
The President. Yes. Okay——
Monkeypox 
Q. Sir, sir, are you pleased with your administration's response to monkeypox? Senator Patty Murray today expressed concern to the HHS.
The President. Well, I've—I think we should be doing all that we possibly can. And I'm getting a report on that on Friday.
Okay?
President Xi Jinping of China 
Q. Do you expect to talk to President Xi soon, sir?
The President. I think I'll be talking to President Xi within the next 10 days.
Coronavirus Containment Efforts 
Q. What's your take on the next steps for COVID, Mr. President? Cases are going up. What should the country be doing right now?
The President. Getting vaccinated.
Q. And for those who aren't?
The President. They've got a problem. It's not in their interest or the public's interest not to get vaccinated. We have the capacity to control it. They should get vaccinated now.
President Xi Jinping of China 
Q. And you said you're going to speak to President Xi in the next 10 days.
The President. I didn't say that. I said I expect to.
Q. Expect to. What will you tell him about tariffs?
The President. I'll tell him to have a good day. No. [Laughter]
Student Loan Debt Relief 
Q. What about the student loan decision, sir? People have said that you're going to make that decision by the end of August. Where does that stand at this point?
The President. By the end of August. [Laughter]

"July 20, 2022","Remarks on Efforts To Combat the Climate Crisis in Somerset, Massachusetts ","Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And thank you for your patience. You've been sitting out here. Appreciate it—please, have a seat, if you have one.
Well, hello, Massachusetts. It's an honor to be with your outstanding Members of Congress today: Senator Ed Markey. Ed? Where's—there you go. Senator Elizabeth Warren. Congressman Auchincloss. Where is she? There you go, Jake. Bill Keating—Congressman.
And your great former Members and one of my dearest friends, John Kerry, who's doing a great job leading our international Special Presidential Envoy on Climate, traveling the world and talking with an awful lot of people he's talking into moving more than they've been doing.
And another great Massachusetts native, Gina McCarthy. Gina? There she is. My National Climate Adviser is leading our climate efforts here at home.
It's an honor to be joined by your neighbor by—your neighbor from Rhode Island. He's not a bad guy at all. [Laughter] I live in his house. Sheldon Whitehouse, a great champion—[laughter]—a great champion of the environment. And he'd been banging away at it.
I come here today with a message: As President, I have a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve when our Nation faces clear and present danger. And that's what climate change is about. It is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger. The health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake.
The U.N.'s leading international climate scientists called the latest climate report nothing less than, quote, ""code red for humanity."" Let me say it again: ""Code red for humanity."" It's not a group of political officials—elected officials. These are the scientists.
We see here in America, in red States and blue States, extreme weather events costing $145 billion—$145 billion—in damages just last year: more powerful and destructive hurricanes and tornadoes. I've flown over the vast majority of them out west and down in Louisiana, all across America. It's amazing to see.
Ravaging hundred-year-old droughts occurring every few years instead of every hundred years. Wildfires out west that have burned and destroyed more than 5 million acres, everything in its path. That is more land than the entire State of New Jersey, from New York down to the tip of Delaware. It's amazing. Five million acres.
Our national security is at stake as well. Extreme weather is already damaging our military installations here in the States. And our economy is at risk. So we have to act. Extreme weather disrupts supply chains, causing delays and shortages for consumers and businesses. Climate change is literally an existential threat to our Nation and to the world.
So my message today is this: Since Congress is not acting as it should—and these guys here are, but we're not getting many Republican votes—this is an emergency. An emergency. And I will—I will—look at it that way.
I said last week and I'll say it again loud and clear: As President, I'll use my executive powers to combat climate—the climate crisis in the absence of congressional actions, notwithstanding their incredible action.
In the coming days, my administration will announce the executive actions we have developed to combat this emergency. We need to act.
But just take a look around: Right now 100 million Americans are under heat alert—100 million Americans. Ninety communities across America set records for high temperatures just this year, including here in New England as we speak.
And by the way, records have been set in the Arctic and the Antarctic, with temperatures that are just unbelievable, melting the permafrost. And it's astounding the damage that's being done.
And this crisis impacts every aspect of our everyday life. That's why today I'm making the largest investment ever—$2.3 billion—to help communities across the country build infrastructure that is designed to withstand the full range of disasters we've been seeing up to today: extreme heat, drought, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes.
Right now there are millions of people suffering from extreme heat at home. So my team is also working with the States to deploy $385 million right now.
For the first time, States will be able to use Federal funds to pay for air conditioners in homes, set up community cooling centers in schools where people can get through these extreme heat crises. And I mean people—and crises that are 100 to 117 degrees.
An infrastructure law that your Members of Congress have delivered includes $3.1 billion to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient, which will lower energy costs while keeping America cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and not using too much energy.
And my Department of Labor, led by a guy named Marty Walsh——
[At this point, the President imitated a Boston accent.]
He talks funny, but he's a hell of a guy. But all kidding aside, Marty was a great mayor, and I know—I know he knows how to get a job done. And he's doing two things for me:
First of all, as Secretary of Labor, he's developing the first-ever workplace standards for extreme heat, saying, under these conditions, if it hits this point—you cannot do the following—you cannot ask people to do a certain thing.
Second, he's sending folks out from the Labor Department to make sure we hold workplaces and—to those standards that are being set. They've already completed over 500 heat-related inspections of workplaces across 43 States. At the end of the day, it's going to save lives.
Now, let me tell you why we're here at Brayton Point. Five years ago, this towering power plant that once stood with cooling towers 500 feet high closed down. The coal plant at Brayton Point was the largest of its kind in New England—1,500 megawatts of power, enough to power one in five Massachusetts homes and businesses.
For over 50 years, this plant supported this region's economy through their electric—the electricity they supplied, the good jobs they provided, and the local taxes they paid.
But the plant, like many others around the country, had another legacy: one of toxins, smog, greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of pollution that contributed to the climate emergency we now face today.
Gina McCarthy, a former regulator in Massachusetts, was telling me on the way up how folks used to get a rag out and wipe the gunk off of their car's windshields in the morning just to be able to drive—not very much unlike where I grew up in a place called Claymont, Delaware—which has more oil refineries than Houston, Texas, had in its region—just across the line in Pennsylvania. And all the prevailing winds were our way.
I just lived up the road. I just—in an apartment complex when we moved to Delaware. And just up the road was a little school I went to, Holy Rosary grade school. And because it was a four-lane highway that was accessible, my mother drove us and—rather than us be able to walk.
And guess what? The first frost, you knew what was happening. You had to put on your windshield wipers to get, literally, the oil slick off the window. That's why I and so damn many other people I grew up [with]* have cancer and why—for the longest time, Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the Nation.
But that's the past, and we're going to get—we're going to build a different future with one—one with clean energy, good-paying jobs.
Just 15 years ago, America generated more than half its electricity from coal—coal-fired plants. Today, that's down to 20 percent because there's a big transition happening. Many of these fossil fuel plants are becoming sites for new clean energy construction. Others are switching to new, clean technologies.
Look at Brayton Point. Today, Brayton is one of the frontiers—on the frontier of clean energy in America. On this site, they'll manufacture four hundred—248 miles of high-tech, heavy-duty cables. Those specialized, subsea cables are necessary to tie offshore wind farms to the existing grid.
Manufacturing these cables will mean good-paying jobs for 250 workers—as many workers as the old plant—power plant had at its peak.
And the port here, 34 feet deep, was used to carry coal into the power plant. Now we're going to use that same port to carry components of—for wind power into the sea. The converter station here and the substation nearby are the assets that move energy across the power lines.
They'll now move clean electricity generated offshore by the wind—enough power to power hundreds of thousands of homes onto the grid—putting old assets to work delivering clean energy. This didn't happen by accident. It happened because we believed and invested in America's innovation and ingenuity.
One of the companies investing in the factory here joined me at the White House this month. Vineyard Winds, whose CEO told me about the ground-breaking project labor agreements they've negotiated and would create good-paying union jobs. And I want to compliment Congressman Bill Keating for his work in this area. I'm also proud to point out that my administration approved the first commercial project for offshore wind in America, which is being constructed by Vineyard Winds.
Folks, elsewhere in the country, we are propeling retrofits and ensuring that even where fossil fuel plant retires, they still have a role in powering the future. In Illinois, for example, the State has launched a broad effort to invest in converting old power plants to solar farms, led by Governor Pritzker. In California, the IBEW members have helped turn a former oil plant into the world's largest battery storage facility—the world's largest facility. In Wyoming, innovators are chosen to—a retiring plant as the next site for the next-generation nuclear plant.
And my administration is a partner in that progress, driving Federal resources and funding to the communities that have powered this country for generations. And that's why they need to be taken care of as well.
I want to thank Cecil Roberts, a friend and president of United Mine Workers of America, and so many other labor leaders who worked with this—worked with on these initiatives.
Since I took office, we've invested more than $4 billion in Federal funding to the 25 hardest hit coal communities in the country, from West Virginia, to Kentucky, to Wyoming, to New Mexico. Through the infrastructure law, we're investing in clean hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture with the largest grid investment in American history.
We've secured $16 billion to clean up abandoned mines and wells, protecting thousands of communities from toxins and waste, particularly methane. And we still—and we're going to seal leaking methane pollution, an incredibly power [powerful]* greenhouse gas that's 40 times more dangerous to the environment than carbon dioxide. And, folks, with American leadership back on climate, I was able to bring more world leaders together than—we got 100 nations together to agree that—at their major conference in Glasgow, England—I mean, Scotland—to change the emissions policies we had.
We've made real progress, but there is an enormous task ahead. We have to keep retaining and recruiting building trades and union electricians for jobs in wind, solar, hydrogen, nuclear, creating even more and better jobs.
We have to revitalize communities, especially those fence-line communities that are smothered by the legacy of pollution. We have to outcompete China and in the world and make these technologies here in the United States, not have to import them.
Folks, when I think about climate change—and I've been saying this for 3 years—I think jobs. Climate change, I think jobs. Almost 100 wind turbines going up off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island with ground broken and work underway.
Jobs manufacturing 2,500-ton steel foundations that anchor these offshore wind farms to the sea's floor. Jobs manufacturing a Jones Act vessel in Texas to service these offshore wind farms.
We're going to make sure that the ocean is open for the clean energy of our future, and everything we can do—give a green light to wind power on the Atlantic coast, where my predecessor's actions only created confusion.
And today we begin the process to develop wind power in the Gulf of Mexico as well for the first time, a real opportunity to power millions of additional homes from wind.
Let's clear the way—let's clear the way—for clean energy and connect these projects to the grid. I've directed my administration to clear every Federal hurdle and streamline Federal permitting that brings these clean energy projects on line right now and right away. And some of you have already come up and talked to me about that.
And while so many Governors and mayors have been strong partners in this fight to tackle climate change, we need all Governors and mayors. We need public utility commissioners and State agency heads. We need electric utilities and developers to stand up and be part of the solution. Don't be a road block.
You all have a duty right now to our economy, to our competitiveness in the world, to the young people in this Nation, and to future generations—and that sounds like hyperbole but it's not; it's real—to act boldly on climate.
And so does Congress, which—notwithstanding the leadership of the men and women that are here today—has failed in this duty. Not a single Republican in Congress stepped up to support my climate plan. Not one.
So let me be clear: Climate change is an emergency. And in the coming weeks, I'm going to use the power I have as President to turn these words into formal, official government actions through the appropriate proclamations, Executive orders, and regulatory power that a President possesses.
And when it comes to fighting the climate change—climate change, I will not take no for an answer. I will do everything in my power to clean our air and water, protect our people's health, to win the clean energy future. This, again, sounds like hyperbole, but our children and grandchildren are counting on us. Not a joke. Not a joke.
If we don't keep it below 1.5 degrees Centigrade, we lose it all. We don't get to turn it around. And the world is counting on us. And this is the United States of America. When we put our hearts and minds to it, there's not a single thing beyond our capacity—I mean it—when we act together. And of all the things we should be acting together on, it's climate. It's climate.
And by the way, my dear mother—God rest her soul—used to say, ""Joey, out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough."" Look what's happening. We're going to be able to create as many or more good-paying jobs. We're going to make environments and where people live safer. We're going to make the clean—the air safer. I really mean it. We have an opportunity here.
I'll bet you when you see what's happened here in this cable construction here—manufacturing—and you go back and ask all the people who grew up in this beautiful place what they'd rather have: Do they want the plant back with everything it had, or what you're going to have? I will be dumbfounded if you find anybody, other than for pure sentimental reasons, saying, ""I'd rather have the coal plant.""
I'll end by telling you another quick story. When we moved from Scranton—when coal died in Scranton, everything died in Scranton. And my dad wasn't a coal miner. My great—my great-grandfather was a mining engineer. But my dad was in sales, and there was no work. So we left to go down to Delaware, where I told you where those oil plants were.
But I remember driving home—when you take the trolley in Scranton, going out North Washington and Adams Avenues. Within 15 blocks—we didn't live in the neighborhood—among the most prestigious neighborhood in the region, in the town where the Scrantons and other good, decent people lived, there was a—you'd go by a wall that—my recollection is, it was somewhere between 15 and 18 feet tall. And it went for the—essentially, a city block.
And you could see the coal piled up to the very top of the wall from inside. It was a coal-fired plant—a coal-fired plant. And all of that—all of the negative impacts of breathing that coal, the dust were effecting everybody. But at the time, people didn't know it and there wasn't any alternative.
Folks, we have no excuse now. We know it. There are answers for it. We can make things better in terms of jobs. We can make things better in terms of the environment. We can make things better for families overall. So I'm looking forward to this movement.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
